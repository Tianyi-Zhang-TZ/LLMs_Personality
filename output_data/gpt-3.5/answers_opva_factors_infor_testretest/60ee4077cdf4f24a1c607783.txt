Conscientiousness: 4.3 
Extraversion: 2.4 

The individual's responses indicate a high level of conscientiousness as they have a strong sense of responsibility in completing tasks and are willing to ask for clarification or help when needed. They also demonstrate a high level of attention to detail in order to avoid making mistakes.

On the other hand, their responses suggest a lower level of extraversion as they tend to feel uncomfortable in social situations, prefer to observe rather than lead in group discussions, and would rather avoid after-work social events. However, they still demonstrate a willingness to listen to their team members and support them when needed.
