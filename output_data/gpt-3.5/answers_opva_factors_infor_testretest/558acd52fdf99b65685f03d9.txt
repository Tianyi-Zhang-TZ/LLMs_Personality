Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual seems to be highly conscientious, showing traits of hard work, thoroughness, and caring about their job and the quality of work they produce. They also show a willingness to pay attention to details and take on challenging activities to grow and learn. 

On the other hand, they seem to be slightly less extraverted, preferring to shy away from leading roles and be more reserved and quiet in group discussions. They enjoy being around others and have friendly and welcoming characteristics, but may not necessarily take on social situations as readily as they do work tasks.
