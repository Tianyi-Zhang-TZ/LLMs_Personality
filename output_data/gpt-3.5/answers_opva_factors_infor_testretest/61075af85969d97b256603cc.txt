Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

Based on the responses, the individual seems to score higher in Conscientiousness as they demonstrate a level of responsibility, attention to detail, and persistence in challenging situations. They also showed a willingness to push themselves and take on challenges, despite feeling overwhelmed at times.

However, their responses also suggest a preference for introversion, which would lower their overall Extraversion score. They tend to feel uncomfortable and anxious in social situations, preferring to keep to themselves or stay quiet. While they do participate in social gatherings and engage with others, it seems to be less of an innate preference and more of a willingness to engage in order to support others or achieve a goal.
