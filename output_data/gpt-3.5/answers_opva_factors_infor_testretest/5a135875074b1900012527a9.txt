Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.0

Based on the answers provided, the individual seems to be conscientious in their approach to work tasks and paying attention to details, which is reflected in their description of taking the time to double and triple check their work and being careful not to make mistakes. They also describe wanting to find ways to get what they want without unduly interfering with others or being impulsive, which further demonstrates conscientiousness.

In terms of extraversion, the individual seems to be more introverted and uncomfortable in social situations where they do not know anyone. While they do make efforts to be friendly and engage with others, they describe feeling uncomfortable and awkward in these situations. Additionally, they describe being more of a listener in group discussions and being happy to lead if necessary but generally waiting to see what others do first. While they do seem to be an encourager in situations where others are feeling down, this is balanced by a tendency to be more reserved and try to avoid after-work social events. Overall, their answers suggest a lower rating on the extraversion factor compared to conscientiousness.
