Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0 

The individual seems to exhibit a high level of conscientiousness based on their willingness to take responsibility and pay close attention to details in various situations. They also appear to have a strong work ethic and a commitment to doing what needs to be done, even when it is challenging. However, their responses indicate a moderate level of extraversion, as they seem to feel uncomfortable in some unfamiliar social situations and do not actively seek out new social experiences or opportunities.
