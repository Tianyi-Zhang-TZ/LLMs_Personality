Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5 

Overall, the individual seems to be highly conscientious, placing a lot of emphasis on doing things right, paying attention to details, and taking responsibility for their work. They also appear to have a strong work ethic, preferring to challenge themselves and learn new things rather than take the easy route. However, they also showed some signs of being avoidant and hesitant to speak up in group situations, which could prevent them from achieving their full potential. In terms of extraversion, they seem to be fairly in the middle, feeling uncomfortable and anxious in large groups of new people, but also showing a desire to connect with others and be part of a team. They also seem to be willing to take social risks and push themselves out of their comfort zones in order to build relationships and achieve their goals.
