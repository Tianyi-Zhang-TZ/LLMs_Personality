Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual shows high levels of conscientiousness as they display a consistent pattern of being responsible, reliable, and detail-oriented in their work and social settings. They prioritize doing things correctly and leaving things in order for the next person to use. However, their level of extraversion is not as strong, as they tend to prefer being alone or withdrawn in social situations, and prioritize their individual goals rather than taking a lead or projecting energy into group discussions.
