Extraversion: 3.0 

The individual demonstrates a strong sense of responsibility and determination in challenging situations (such as Question 2 and 4), indicating a higher level of Conscientiousness. However, they also tend to feel uncomfortable in social situations (Question 1 and 5) which suggests a lower level of Extraversion. They are willing to take on leadership roles in areas of their expertise (Question 3) but are also more likely to approach tasks and decisions methodically rather than impulsively (Question 8). Overall, the individual demonstrates a moderate level of Extraversion and a relatively high level of Conscientiousness.
