Unfortunately, based on the answers given, it's difficult to provide overall ratings for the six factors of the HEXCO personality model as there were significant challenges with the clarity and completeness of the responses. Many of the answers provided were tangential to the questions asked and made very little reference to the specific personality traits assessed. Additionally, some of the answers were difficult to understand due to poor sentence structure, grammar, and vocabulary. 

To provide an accurate rating, the answers should include more specific details about the individual's behavior, thoughts, and feelings in each situation. In particular, providing examples of how the individual acted in a certain way or made decisions would help in rating their personality traits. Without this level of specificity, it's challenging to give a meaningful rating.
