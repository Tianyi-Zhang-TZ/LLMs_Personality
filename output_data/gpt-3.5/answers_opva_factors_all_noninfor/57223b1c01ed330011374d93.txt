I'm sorry, but based on the answers provided, it is difficult to accurately rate the personality score of this individual according to the HEXACO personality model. The answers are unclear, incoherent, and lack specific details about the individual's behavior and motivations. It is important to have clear and detailed information about a person's thoughts, behaviors, and emotions in order to accurately rate their personality score. Without further information, I cannot provide a personality rating.
