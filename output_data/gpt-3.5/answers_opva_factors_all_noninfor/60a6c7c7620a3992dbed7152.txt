Unfortunately, I cannot provide an overall rating for personality based on the given answers as they do not contain enough information and coherence to assess the person's personality traits. The answers contain several non-related topics, fragmented sentences, and incomplete thoughts, making it challenging to evaluate the person's personality accurately. Further comprehensive and organized responses are necessary to assess the person's personality traits.
