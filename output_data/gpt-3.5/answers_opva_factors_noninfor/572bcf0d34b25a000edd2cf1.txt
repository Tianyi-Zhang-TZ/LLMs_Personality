Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The person's responses suggest a relatively low score in extraversion, as they describe themselves as shy and withdrawn in social situations where they don't know others. However, they do become more outgoing and engaged when they become interested in a topic. This suggests a moderate level of openness to experience, which is not assessed in this HEXCO model.

The person's high score in conscientiousness is evident in their responses to questions about work-related tasks and attention to detail. They describe themselves as a problem-solver who is proactive and committed to completing tasks, and they feel a sense of accomplishment when they do so. They also describe themselves as organized and able to keep conversations flowing in group discussions, which suggests a conscientious approach to social interactions as well.
