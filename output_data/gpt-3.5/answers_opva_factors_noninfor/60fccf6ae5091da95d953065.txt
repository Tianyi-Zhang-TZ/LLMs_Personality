Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The person appears to be moderately extraverted, as they do enjoy social interaction and are open to attending after-work social events, but also have moments of discomfort in social situations with unfamiliar people. They also seem to take a balanced approach in group discussions, preferring to both listen and assume a leading role. 

In terms of conscientiousness, the person appears to highly value attention to detail and avoiding mistakes, as well as being responsible and reliable in completing tasks. They also demonstrate a compassionate and helpful attitude towards team members who are feeling down. However, in situations where they want something badly, they may act impulsively even if it means taking on more than they can handle.
