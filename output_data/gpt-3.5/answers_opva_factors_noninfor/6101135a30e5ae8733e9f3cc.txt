Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The individual exhibits signs of introversion in several situations, such as feeling uncomfortable in social settings and taking on a listening role in group discussions. However, they also exhibit signs of sociability, as seen in their decision to join an after-work social event despite being introverted. In terms of conscientiousness, they demonstrate attention to detail and a willingness to push themselves harder to complete tasks, but also acknowledge their self-consciousness and tendency to shy away from leadership roles. Overall, the individual seems to fall somewhere in the middle when it comes to these two personality factors.
