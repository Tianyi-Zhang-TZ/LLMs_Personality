Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.5

Overall, the individual's responses suggest a moderate level of extraversion, as they described themselves as shy and quiet in social situations where they do not know anyone, and generally prefer to spend time with a tight-knit group of friends rather than branching out to meet new people. However, they also mentioned being more outgoing and charismatic when they make an effort to be. 

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual consistently described themselves as detail-oriented, perfectionistic, and hardworking, with a strong sense of responsibility to get things done and help others. They also mentioned being selfless and willing to work harder than others to support their colleagues, which aligns with the trait of conscientiousness. Therefore, a high rating for conscientiousness is appropriate.
