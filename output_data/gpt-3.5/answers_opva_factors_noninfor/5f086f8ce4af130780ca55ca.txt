Conscientiousness: 4.5 

The individual describes themselves as generally extroverted, but can experience discomfort in new social settings where they don't know anyone. However, they still try to open up and enjoy themselves. When it comes to tasks, the individual is conscientious and pays attention to detail, often being described as obsessive-compulsive in their need for organization and putting things back in their place. They are willing to push themselves harder when faced with challenging tasks and seek help from others if necessary. Overall, their conscientiousness outweighs their lower extraversion score.
