Extraversion: 4.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The individual's responses suggest a generally outgoing and extroverted personality, especially in social situations where they tend to seek out interaction and connections with others. They also demonstrate a somewhat conscientious approach towards tasks and responsibilities, being organized and responsible when using other people's property. However, the responses also indicate a tendency towards impulsiveness and a go-getter attitude when pursuing goals.
