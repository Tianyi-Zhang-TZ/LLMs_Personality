The interviewee demonstrated good communication flexibility by adapting their communication style to suit different situations (e.g. asking questions in social situations). They also showed a strong quality orientation by emphasizing the importance of delivering high-quality work and seeking to avoid mistakes. However, their persuasive skills were not as consistently strong, with some answers lacking a clear argument or persuasive approach.
