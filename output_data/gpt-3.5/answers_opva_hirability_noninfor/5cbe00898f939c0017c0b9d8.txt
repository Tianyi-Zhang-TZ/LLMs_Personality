The interviewee showed moderate communication flexibility, as they were able to convey their message in different situations but were not consistently adaptable to different perceptions and responses. Their persuasiveness was slightly lacking, as they did not always use the best arguments or diplomacy to gain agreement with others. However, they demonstrated a strong quality orientation, consistently making an effort to deliver high-quality work and exceed established standards. They also showed a moderate development orientation, exerting themselves to gain new experiences and grow professionally. Overall, the interviewee has potential for the management traineeship position, but may need to further develop their communication and persuasion skills.
