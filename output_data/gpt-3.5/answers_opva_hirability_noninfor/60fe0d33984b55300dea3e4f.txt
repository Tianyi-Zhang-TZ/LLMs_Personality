They displayed low levels of persuasiveness, as they tended to take a listening role in group discussions and might not feel comfortable taking a leadership role immediately. However, they demonstrated strong quality orientation and development orientation, being a highly organized individual who pays great attention to details and who is committed to broadening and deepening their knowledge and skills.
