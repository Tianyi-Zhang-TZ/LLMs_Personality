The interviewee demonstrated some level of communication flexibility, particularly in the first question where they were able to adjust their behavior in a new social setting. However, they struggled with persuasion skills, as seen in the third question where they preferred a more collaborative leadership style rather than actively trying to persuade others to follow their ideas. The interviewee showed strong quality and development orientation, indicating a willingness to deliver high-quality work and to grow professionally. Overall, the candidate seems hireable but may benefit from additional development in persuasive communication skills.
