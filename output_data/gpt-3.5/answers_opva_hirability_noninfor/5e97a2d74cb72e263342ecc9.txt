Communication flexibility: 3.5
Persuasiveness: 2.5
Quality orientation: 3.5
Development orientation: 3.0
Overall hireability: 3.0

The interviewee demonstrates some level of communication flexibility by being able to adapt to social situations, but it is not a strong competency as they tend to be introverted and closed off in new situations. Their persuasiveness is also not strong, as they struggle with speaking parts and do not seem to have a well-considered use of arguments. However, their quality orientation and development orientation are decent, as they prioritize delivering high-quality work and strive to broaden and deepen their knowledge and skills. Overall, while there are areas for improvement, the interviewee has potential for the traineeship position.
