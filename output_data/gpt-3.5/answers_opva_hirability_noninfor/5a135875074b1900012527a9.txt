The interviewee's responses were often hard to follow and did not directly answer the questions asked. The interviewee also had some difficulty organizing their thoughts and expressing themselves clearly, which resulted in a low rating for communication flexibility and persuasiveness. However, the interviewee did express a strong commitment to quality and development, which resulted in higher ratings for those competencies. Overall, while the interviewee had some strengths, their communication abilities would be a concern for their ability to fulfill the requirements of a management traineeship position.
