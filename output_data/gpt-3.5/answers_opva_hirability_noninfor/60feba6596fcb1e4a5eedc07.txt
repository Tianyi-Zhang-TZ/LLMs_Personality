Their persuasiveness was also average, as they did not use well-considered arguments or personal authority to gain agreement from others. However, they showed a strong quality orientation by making an effort to deliver high-quality work, focusing on achieving or exceeding established quality standards. Additionally, their development orientation was evident as they expressed a desire to broaden and deepen their knowledge and skills.
