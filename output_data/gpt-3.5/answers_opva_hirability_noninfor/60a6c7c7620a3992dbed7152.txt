Overall hireability: 2.5

The interviewee struggled with communication flexibility and often had difficulty conveying their message clearly and coherently. Their persuasiveness also lacked in some instances, as they struggled to provide well-considered arguments or use personal authority. However, they demonstrated a strong focus on delivering high-quality work and an interest in gaining new experiences to improve professionally. Overall, while they had some strengths in their work-oriented competencies, their communication skills may hinder their ability to succeed in the management traineeship position. As such, their overall hireability rating is somewhat lower.
