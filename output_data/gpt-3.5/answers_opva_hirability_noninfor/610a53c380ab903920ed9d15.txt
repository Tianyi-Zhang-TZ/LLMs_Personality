The interviewee showed moderate communication flexibility, as they were able to adjust their personality to fit the social setting, but could have gone further in conveying their message in different ways. They also showed some persuasiveness in taking the lead in a group discussion and establishing ground rules, but not to the extent of gaining strong agreement or acceptance from others. The interviewee demonstrated strong quality orientation by making an effort to perform their tasks well and paying close attention to details.
