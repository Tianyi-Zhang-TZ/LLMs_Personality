The interviewee showed some ability to adapt communication style in Question 1, however, further elaboration on how they communicate in different ways would have been helpful. In terms of persuasiveness, the interviewee did not show strong examples of effectively convincing others or presenting well-considered arguments. However, the interviewee demonstrated strong quality orientation in Questions 2 and 6, where attention to detail and organization were emphasized.
