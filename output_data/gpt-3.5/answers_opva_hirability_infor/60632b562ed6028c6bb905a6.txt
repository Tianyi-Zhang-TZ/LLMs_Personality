Persuasiveness: 2.5
The interviewee's responses did not demonstrate a strong ability to persuade others or present well-considered arguments. Their answers often lacked structure and coherence, which could hinder their ability to gain acceptance or agreement from others.

Quality orientation: 3.0
While the interviewee did express a desire to deliver high-quality work, their responses did not provide concrete examples or demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving or exceeding established quality standards.
