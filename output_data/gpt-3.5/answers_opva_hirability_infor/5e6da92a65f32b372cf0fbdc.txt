Communication flexibility: 3.5
The interviewee demonstrated some flexibility in their communication by adapting their communication style to fit the social setting they described in question 1. They mentioned that they tried to be polite and well-mannered when engaging in conversation with people they did not know. However, there were instances where their communication became awkward, such as when they were eating messy food and trying to maintain a conversation. Overall, they showed some flexibility in their communication, but there is room for improvement.

Persuasiveness: 2.5
Throughout the interview, the interviewee did not provide any examples or demonstrate strong persuasive abilities. They did mention that they tried to give advice and influence others during a group discussion in question 3, but it was unclear if their attempts were successful or persuasive. Therefore, their persuasiveness skills seem to be limited.

Quality orientation: 3.0
The interviewee demonstrated some level of quality orientation in their description of their work as a custodian in question 2. They emphasized the importance of keeping things organized and following strict guidelines for where equipment and supplies should be placed. However, there were no other examples provided to further assess their attention to detail or commitment to delivering high-quality work. Thus, their quality orientation seems to be average.

Development orientation: 2.5
The interviewee mentioned their desire to broaden their knowledge and skills in coding in question 6. However, they also shared that they gave up on coding because it was challenging and frustrating for them. This suggests a lack of perseverance and willingness to push themselves to grow professionally. Therefore, their development orientation may need improvement.

Overall hireability: 2.8
Based on the provided responses, the interviewee demonstrated average to below-average ratings in the key competencies. While they showed some flexibility in communication and a certain level of quality orientation, their persuasiveness and development orientation were lacking. Additionally, their overall hireability is affected by their lack of examples or strong demonstrations of the desired competencies. However, it is important to note that their hireability cannot be solely determined based on these limited responses.
