Quality orientation: 3.5
The interviewee demonstrated some level of conscientiousness and a focus on delivering high-quality work by acknowledging the need to pay attention to details and their ambition to do their best. However, they also mentioned making a couple of mistakes, which suggests room for improvement in terms of consistently achieving or exceeding established quality standards.

Development orientation: 2.5
While the interviewee mentioned being ambitious and wanting to improve themselves professionally, they did not provide strong examples of actively seeking opportunities to broaden and deepen their knowledge and skills or actively pursuing new experiences to grow professionally.
