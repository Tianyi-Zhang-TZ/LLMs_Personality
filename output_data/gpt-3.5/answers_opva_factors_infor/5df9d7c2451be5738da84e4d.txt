Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0
Overall, the individual seems to have a moderate level of extraversion, as seen in their tendency to become uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings, but also their comfort in bouncing between listening and leading roles in group settings. They also prioritize spending time with friends and family outside of work rather than attending after-work social events. In terms of conscientiousness, the individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness in their attention to detail, desire for first call resolution in their work, and strategic approach to achieving their goals. However, there is still some flexibility shown in delegating tasks to others when necessary instead of trying to do everything themselves.
