Extraversion: 2.5 rating
Conscientiousness: 3.5 rating

The individual showed more introverted tendencies in social situations, such as feeling uncomfortable when in a room full of people they didn't know and not wanting to socialize after work. However, they did show ambition and drive in their career, which aligns with extraversion. They also displayed some conscientiousness in paying attention to details and completing challenging tasks, but also demonstrated impulsivity in acting on their desire for a promotion without much consideration. Overall, the individual seems to fall in the middle range for both factors.
