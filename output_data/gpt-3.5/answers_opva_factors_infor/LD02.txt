Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.0 

The individual seems to have a high level of extraversion based on their enjoyment of meeting new people, their natural ability to break the ice in social situations, and their tendency to take a leading role in group discussions. They also have a fear of missing out on social events and enjoy raising the spirits of their team members.

However, their conscientiousness appears to be moderate. They have a desire to be perceived as competent and strive to avoid mistakes, but also feel frustrated and insecure in situations that require attention to detail. They can be impulsive in morally neutral situations, but their moral values guide their decisions in other situations.
