Based on the answers provided, I would rate the personality as follows:

Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual self-described as being more shy than usual in social settings and typically taking on a listening role in group discussions, both of which indicate a lower level of Extraversion. They also mentioned a strong preference for following rules, respecting others, and double-checking their work, which suggests a higher level of Conscientiousness. While they did mention a desire to lift team members' spirits when they are feeling down, overall their answers suggest a slightly lower level of Extraversion.
