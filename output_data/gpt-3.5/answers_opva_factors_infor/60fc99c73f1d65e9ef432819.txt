Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The responses indicate a lower level of extraversion as there were several instances where the individual explained discomfort in social situations and a preference for listening over leading in group discussions. However, there were also moments where they were confident and willing to share their opinions in group settings. In terms of conscientiousness, the responses consistently demonstrated a high level of attention to detail, a desire to improve organizational systems, and a willingness to put in effort to learn and adopt new skills. Additionally, the individual showed empathy and compassion towards their coworkers and a willingness to work hard to raise team spirit. Therefore, a higher rating for conscientiousness is appropriate.
