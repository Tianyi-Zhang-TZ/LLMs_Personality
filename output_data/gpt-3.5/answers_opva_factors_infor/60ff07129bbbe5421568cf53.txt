Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The responses suggest that the person tends to be more introverted than extroverted as they feel uncomfortable in social situations and prefer to be reserved unless they feel confident or there are no other speakers. However, they do have moments where they assume a leading role or try to lift people's spirits if they feel they know what to say. 

On the other hand, the person seems to be more conscientious than not as they are careful with details, push themselves harder when facing challenges, and are willing to ask questions or review instructions to avoid making mistakes. They also do not act impulsively or take shortcuts to get what they want, indicating a sense of responsibility and self-discipline.
