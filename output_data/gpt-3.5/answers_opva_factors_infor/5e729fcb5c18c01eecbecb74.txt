Based on the responses given, the overall ratings for each factor are:

Conscientiousness: 3.8 
Extraversion: 3.4 

The reason for a higher score in Conscientiousness is that the individual in their responses emphasized their tendency to be diligent and organized in completing tasks, paying attention to details, and being productive in the workplace. The individual shows a strong work ethic and takes responsibility for their actions, which are key components of Conscientiousness.

The reason for a slightly lower score in Extraversion is that while the individual is generally outgoing and talkative, several of their responses indicated a tendency to be more reserved in new or unfamiliar social situations. They also mentioned enjoying listening more than speaking up in group discussions. While they do have social skills and enjoy socializing, they may not be as naturally extroverted as others in all situations.
