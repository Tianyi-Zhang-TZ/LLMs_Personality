Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual tends to be somewhat reserved in new social situations, but is still confident in their abilities and willing to branch out and interact with others. In group settings, they prefer to listen and allow for group consensus rather than dictating their own ideas. However, when it comes to work-related tasks and responsibilities, they are highly conscientious and aware of the impact their actions may have on others and the organization. They are driven to complete tasks well and on time. Overall, this suggests a moderately extraverted and highly conscientious personality.
