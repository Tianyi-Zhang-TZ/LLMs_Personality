Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The answers provided suggest a personality leaning towards introversion (low Extraversion) and carefulness and attention to detail (moderate-high Conscientiousness). The individual tends to keep to themselves in social situations (Q1) and does not see the necessity of raising others' spirits (Q7), which are behaviours typical of introverts. They also focus on maintaining high quality in their work (Q2) and pay attention to detail (Q6), indicating conscientiousness. However, they do not show high levels of ambition or impulsivity in achieving their goals (Q4, Q8), which would be behaviours typical of those high in Conscientiousness. Overall, their responses suggest a moderate score in Conscientiousness and a low-moderate score in Extraversion.
