Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The responses provided suggest that the individual may lean slightly towards introversion rather than extraversion based on their tendency to prefer a listening role, feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they do not know anyone, and not enjoying after-work social events. However, there were instances where they may have exhibited slightly more extraverted behavior such as telling bad jokes to raise team member's spirits and being annoyed by certain situations. 

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual appears to have a strong desire to complete tasks and solve problems themselves before seeking help. They also exhibit a high level of detail-orientedness when it comes to their work and may become frustrated if they are unable to complete a task perfectly. However, they may not exhibit as high of a score as someone who would consistently and without hesitation take on more responsibility or extra tasks and prioritize deadlines.
