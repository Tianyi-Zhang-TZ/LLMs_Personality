Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

Overall, the individual's responses suggest that they have a moderate level of extraversion, as they are willing to put themselves in social situations but may become quiet and reserved in unfamiliar settings. They also seem to prioritize keeping the mood light and raising team morale. On the other hand, their level of conscientiousness appears to be somewhat lower, as they describe being easily frustrated by detail-oriented tasks and may not always prioritize completing tasks to the best of their ability. They do, however, recognize the importance of taking care of themselves and avoiding emotionally draining situations.
