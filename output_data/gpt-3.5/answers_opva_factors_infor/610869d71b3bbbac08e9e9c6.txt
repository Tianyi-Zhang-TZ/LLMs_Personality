Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.5 

The responses suggest that the person tends to be introverted and uncomfortable in social situations, often assuming a listening role rather than taking charge in group discussions. They also struggle to push themselves when faced with challenging tasks, and would rather leave the task aside or pass it to someone else. However, they do try to raise the spirits of their team members when they are down. On the other hand, they are conscientious in their work, pay close attention to detail, and try their best to get things done correctly. Overall, the combination of these tendencies suggests a neutral level of extraversion and a slightly higher level of conscientiousness.
