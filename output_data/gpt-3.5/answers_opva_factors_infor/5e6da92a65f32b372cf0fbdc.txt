Conscientiousness: 4.2
The individual has demonstrated a high level of conscientiousness by showing organization, carefulness, and thoroughness particularly in dealing with tasks or responsibilities. Such behaviors were evident especially in his role at work as a custodian, his intent to learn coding despite its considerable challenges, and his decision regarding the found stool.

Extraversion: 2.8
While the individual displayed some instances of sociable and outgoing behaviors, he also showed a tendency to be reserved and prefer smaller, familiar social settings. This is largely evidenced by his actions and sentiments during social gatherings and team activities where he often showed discretion, sometimes leaning towards avoidance, instead of eagerly seeking interaction or proactively reaching out. He did exhibit some ability to handle leadership roles and raise teammate spirits but only to a moderate extent, indicating a somewhat lower degree of extraversion overall.
