Extraversion: 4.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The answers provided suggest that the person is generally outgoing, social, and enjoys interacting with others (higher on Extraversion), but also exhibits some level of carefulness, attention to detail, and planning (moderately high on Conscientiousness). While there are some instances where the person may be more passive or avoidant (such as in Question 4), overall their personality seems to be relatively balanced between these two factors.
