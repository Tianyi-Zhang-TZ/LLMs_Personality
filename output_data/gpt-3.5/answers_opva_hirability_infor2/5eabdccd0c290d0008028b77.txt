- Persuasiveness: The candidate's answers do not demonstrate the ability to gain acceptance or agreement from others through well-considered arguments or personal authority. Their responses lack persuasion and diplomacy. Therefore, a rating of 2.0 is appropriate.
- Quality orientation: The candidate's answers show a lack of attention to detail and a disregard for completing tasks accurately. They mention rushing, not putting things back in place, and not paying attention to avoid mistakes. This indicates a low focus on delivering high-quality work. Hence, a rating of 1.0 is given.
- Development orientation: The candidate's answers do not indicate a strong desire for self-improvement, gaining new experiences, or increasing the quality of their work. They do not mention seeking growth or acquiring new skills. Therefore, a rating of 2.0 is appropriate.
- Overall hireability: The candidate's responses demonstrate a lack of competencies required for the traineeship position. They struggle with communication, persuasiveness, attention to detail, and self-improvement. As a result, their overall hireability rating is 2.0.

These ratings are based on the candidate's answers provided and indicate a need for significant improvement in the assessed competencies for them to be suitable for the traineeship.
