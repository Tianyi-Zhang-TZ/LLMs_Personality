Therefore, they receive a rating of 2.5.

Quality orientation: The candidate shows a high level of quality orientation. They mention being organized and tidy in their work life and taking pride in delivering high-quality work. Their emphasis on aesthetics and attention to detail indicates a strong commitment to achieving or exceeding established quality standards. Therefore, they receive a rating of 4.0.

Development orientation: Although the candidate mentions being a self-starter and having a hard time asking for help, their answer does not explicitly demonstrate a strong desire to broaden their knowledge, gain new experiences, or grow professionally. Therefore, they receive a rating of 3.0.

Overall hireability: Taking into account the ratings for the job-related competencies, the candidate's overall hireability is determined to be 3.25. While they show strengths in quality orientation, there is room for improvement in communication flexibility, persuasiveness, and development orientation.
