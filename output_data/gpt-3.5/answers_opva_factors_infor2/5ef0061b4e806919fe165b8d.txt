Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 3.0

My rating of Extraversion is 3.5 because the individual expressed a preference for being alone and feeling more comfortable in social settings where they don't know anyone. However, they also mentioned being observant of others and trying to engage in conversations, indicating some willingness to interact with others.

My rating of Conscientiousness is 3.0 because the individual highlighted their need for a plan or structure when taking on a leading role in a group discussion and also emphasized the importance of being organized and focused in tasks that require attention to detail. However, they also mentioned being relaxed and sometimes having difficulty controlling their emotions, which suggests a slight lower level of conscientiousness.
