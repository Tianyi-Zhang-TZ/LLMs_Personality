Based on the responses provided, I would rate the individual as follows:

Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual describes themselves as introverted and uncomfortable in social settings where they don't know anyone. While they can put aside their discomfort and act professionally in such situations, they still feel awkward and uncomfortable. They also mention feeling uncomfortable in larger social events and prefer smaller functions. Additionally, they tend to hide their true feelings and appear more social than they actually are. These responses suggest a lower level of extraversion.

On the other hand, the individual expresses a strong inclination towards maintaining order, organization, and rule-following in their work environment. They have a tendency to keep things in order and feel proud when they do so. They are conscientious about putting equipment back in place properly and ensuring that they are respectful to the next person who will use it. They also mention their confidence in paying attention to details and avoiding mistakes in tasks. These responses suggest a higher level of conscientiousness.

Overall, the individual's responses indicate a moderate level of extraversion and a higher level of conscientiousness.
