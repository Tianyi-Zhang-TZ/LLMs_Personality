Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

I have rated the individual's Extraversion as 2.5 because they mentioned feeling nervous and shy in social settings where they don't know anyone. They also mentioned being a relatively private person and declining invitations to social events that they felt were not necessary for their own benefit. While they do try to raise others' spirits and contribute to group discussions when they perceive a need, overall their responses indicate a tendency towards introversion.

The individual's Conscientiousness has been rated as 4.0 because they consistently demonstrated a conscientious attitude towards their work. They mentioned being careful, detail-oriented, and taking their work seriously. They also mentioned being reliable and committed to completing tasks successfully, as well as showing consideration for colleagues by returning borrowed items promptly. These qualities indicate a high level of conscientiousness.
