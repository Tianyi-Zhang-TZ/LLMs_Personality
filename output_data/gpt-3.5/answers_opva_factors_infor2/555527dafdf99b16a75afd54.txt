Extraversion: 4.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual appears to be highly extraverted, as they enjoy trying new things, actively seek out people in social settings, contribute and actively listen during group discussions, enthusiastically accept invitations to social events, and go out of their way to raise team members' spirits. They demonstrate a high level of social engagement, assertiveness, and enthusiasm.

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual is organized, focused on details, and motivated to complete tasks even when faced with challenges or lack of expertise. They demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility by carefully organizing and returning equipment, diligently completing a forensic audit task despite not having any accounting experience, and ensuring that no detail was overlooked during scheduling blitzes. However, their conscientiousness rating is slightly lower than their extraversion rating as they also demonstrate some impulsivity in their decision-making process, initially acting on impulse to show interest in a project but then following up with a deliberate and well-prepared presentation. Overall, the individual displays a high level of responsibility and motivation in their actions.
