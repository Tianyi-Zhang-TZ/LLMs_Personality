Extraversion: 2.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

I rated the Extraversion factor as 2.0 because the individual mentioned being soft-spoken and finding it difficult to speak up in social situations where they don't know anyone. They also mentioned leaning more toward listening in group discussions and sometimes needing to go home instead of attending after-work social events. These behaviors indicate a lower inclination towards extraversion.

On the other hand, I rated the Conscientiousness factor as 4.0. The person consistently described themselves as conscientious, paying attention to detail, following rules, and being a hard worker. They also mentioned pushing themselves and being determined to get the job done. These behaviors demonstrate a higher level of conscientiousness.
