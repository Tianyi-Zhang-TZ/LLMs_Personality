Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

I rated the Extraversion factor as 2.5 because the individual mentioned feeling uncomfortable in social situations, preferring to work at home, and experiencing anxiety around meeting new people and making new friends. These characteristics suggest a lower level of extraversion.

For Conscientiousness, I rated it as 4.0 because the individual mentioned having a preference for a clean work environment, not liking clutter, always putting things back in their place, and being determined to finish tasks they start. These traits indicate a higher level of conscientiousness.

Overall, the individual appears to be less extraverted and more conscientious based on their descriptions and behaviors in various situations.
