Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual seems to have a moderate level of conscientiousness, as they mention putting things away at work and paying attention to details, but also admit to forgetting things and feeling stressed. Their extraversion appears to be on the lower side, as they describe feeling uncomfortable in social settings, not attending after-work events often, and trying to stay quiet in group discussions. However, they do show some willingness to share their thoughts and be a positive influence on their team members.
