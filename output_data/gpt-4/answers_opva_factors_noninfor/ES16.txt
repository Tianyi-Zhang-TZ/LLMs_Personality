Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness by showing responsibility in their work, paying attention to details, and being organized. They also express the importance of being fair to others and maintaining a clean and organized workspace. However, they may not be at the highest level of conscientiousness as they mention being stubborn and sometimes needing to push themselves to complete tasks.

In terms of extraversion, the individual seems to be moderately extroverted. They describe themselves as being more of a listener in group discussions but are also open to taking on a leading role when necessary. They enjoy socializing with coworkers and attending after-work events, but also mention being a "silent guy" initially in social situations. This indicates that they may not be extremely extroverted, but still have a good balance of social skills and engagement.
