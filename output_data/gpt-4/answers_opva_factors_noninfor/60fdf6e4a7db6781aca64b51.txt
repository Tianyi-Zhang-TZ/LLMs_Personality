Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.5

The individual seems to be somewhat introverted, as they mentioned being shy and quiet in social settings, preferring to keep work and personal life separate, and not being very comfortable in after-work social events. However, they do make an effort to introduce themselves and engage with others when necessary. This is why I gave them a 2.5 for extraversion.

As for conscientiousness, the individual appears to be very responsible and organized. They mentioned putting equipment back in place, taking notes during meetings, pushing themselves to complete challenging tasks, and paying attention to details. They also show concern for their team members and try to help them when they are feeling down. This is why I gave them a 4.5 for conscientiousness.
