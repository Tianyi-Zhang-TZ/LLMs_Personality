Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual seems to be more introverted, as they mentioned feeling uncomfortable in social situations and preferring to be quiet and reserved. However, they also mentioned trying to be a mood maker and wanting to help others, which shows some level of extraversion. Therefore, I would rate their extraversion as 2.5.

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual appears to be quite diligent and hardworking. They mentioned being focused on completing tasks early, paying attention to details, and trying to be a good team member. This suggests a high level of conscientiousness, which I would rate as 4.0.
