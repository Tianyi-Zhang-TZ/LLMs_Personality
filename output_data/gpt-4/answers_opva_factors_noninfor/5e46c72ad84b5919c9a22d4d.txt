Extraversion: 4.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The individual seems to be quite outgoing and enjoys meeting new people, as seen in their response to Question 1. They also tend to take on leadership roles in group discussions (Question 3) and try to raise the spirits of their team members (Question 7). This indicates a higher level of extraversion.

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual shows a mix of being detail-oriented and responsible (Question 6) but also admits to sometimes struggling with pushing through challenges (Question 4) and not always being empathetic (Question 7). They seem to have a moderate level of conscientiousness, as they are aware of their weaknesses and are working on improving them.
