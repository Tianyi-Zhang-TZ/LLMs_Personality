Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The individual seems to have a moderate level of extraversion, as they mentioned feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know many people (Question 1 and 5), but they also show some willingness to engage with others and raise their spirits (Question 7). Their conscientiousness appears to be slightly higher, as they demonstrate a sense of responsibility in putting equipment away at work (Question 2) and paying attention to details during an exam (Question 6). However, their responses to some questions (e.g., Question 4) are not as clear, making it difficult to determine their level of conscientiousness with certainty.
