Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual seems to be highly conscientious, as evidenced by their strong sense of obligation and attention to detail in tasks. They also seem to prioritize following procedures and rules, even when it may be challenging or mundane. However, they do not appear to be particularly extraverted, as they tend to take a more reserved and listening role in group discussions and social situations.
