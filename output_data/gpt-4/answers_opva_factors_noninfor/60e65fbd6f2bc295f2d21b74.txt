Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual demonstrates a good level of conscientiousness, as they show responsibility in putting tools back in place at work, pay attention to details, and push themselves to take on challenging tasks. However, their extraversion score is slightly lower, as they seem to be more comfortable in social situations when they know people and may not be as outgoing in unfamiliar settings. They do enjoy attending after-work events and getting to know their coworkers, but they also mention being affected by others' emotions and may not always take the initiative to raise the spirits of their team members.
