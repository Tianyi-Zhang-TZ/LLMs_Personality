Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual seems to have a relatively low level of extraversion, as they describe themselves as shy, quiet, and not very personable in social situations where they don't know anyone (Question 1). They also tend to skip after-work social events (Question 5). However, they have shown some leadership qualities in group discussions (Question 3) and empathize with team members when they are feeling down (Question 7), which indicates a slightly higher level of extraversion in certain situations.

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual appears to be quite high. They describe themselves as being helpful and attentive to detail in various situations, such as cleaning up after using equipment (Question 2) and focusing on tasks that require attention to detail (Question 6). They also show determination in challenging situations (Question 4) and a willingness to help others (Question 7). While they mention some impulsiveness (Question 8), it seems to be more related to personal desires rather than work situations, suggesting that they maintain a high level of conscientiousness in professional settings.
