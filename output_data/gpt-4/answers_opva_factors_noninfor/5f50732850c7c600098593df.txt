Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, organization, and focus on completing tasks efficiently. They also show a strong sense of responsibility and adaptability in their work, such as taking on extra tasks when their partner is injured and being analytical in finding ways to improve their work situation.

However, their extraversion score is lower due to their reluctance and anxiety in social situations, such as attending after-work events.

Overall, their personality leans more towards introversion, but they are still capable of adapting to different roles in group settings.
