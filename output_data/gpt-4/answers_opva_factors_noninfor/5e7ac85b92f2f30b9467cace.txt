Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The person seems to have a moderate level of extraversion, as they are comfortable in social situations and can socialize with others, but they also tend to take a listening role in group discussions. They are willing to attend social events with friends but avoid school events where they don't feel as connected to the people.

Their conscientiousness appears to be relatively high, as they are diligent in completing tasks, even when they are challenging or tedious. They also show a strong sense of responsibility and ethics, as evidenced by their refusal to cheat on tests and their focus on learning the material rather than just getting a good grade.
