Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, organization, and desire to follow rules and complete tasks correctly. They also show empathy and concern for others, which contributes to their conscientious nature. However, their extraversion score is lower due to their introverted tendencies, such as feeling shy and quiet in social situations, preferring to listen rather than lead in group discussions, and needing to plan and schedule social events to feel comfortable. They do show some extraverted qualities, such as trying to make others feel comfortable and valued in group settings, but overall, their extraversion score is lower than their conscientiousness score.
