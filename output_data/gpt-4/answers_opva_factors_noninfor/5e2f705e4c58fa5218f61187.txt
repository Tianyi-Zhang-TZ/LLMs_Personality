Extraversion: 2.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The individual's answers indicate a lower level of extraversion, as they often prefer to be alone, listen rather than lead in group discussions, and are not particularly interested in attending social events. However, they are willing to engage in social situations if there is a benefit or necessity.

Their conscientiousness rating is slightly above average, as they demonstrate a tendency to put things back in their place, pay attention to details, and offer practical advice to others when needed. They also seem to be aware of the importance of planning and considering the bigger picture. However, their willingness to quit tasks if the results are not important enough and their lack of experience in certain work situations prevent a higher rating.
