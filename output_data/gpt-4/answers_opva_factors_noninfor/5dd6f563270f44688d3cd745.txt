Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual displays a high level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their desire to complete tasks thoroughly and accurately, pay attention to details, and take responsibility for their role in group discussions. They also exhibit a strong work ethic and are willing to push themselves to learn new things and take on challenging tasks.

However, the individual also shows a lower level of extraversion, preferring to be alone or in smaller social situations rather than large, unfamiliar groups. While they are willing to participate in after-work social events, they do so primarily for professional reasons and prefer to guard their behavior carefully to avoid negative impacts on their work.
