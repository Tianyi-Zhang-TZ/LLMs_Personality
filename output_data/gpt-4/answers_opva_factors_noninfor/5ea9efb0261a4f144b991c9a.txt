The individual demonstrates a relatively high level of extraversion, as they describe themselves as affable, socially adept, and a natural leader. They also mention their ability to pick up on social cues and engage in networking. However, they also show some conscientiousness, as they mention wanting to get things done right the first time and being detail-oriented when necessary. They also describe themselves as a problem solver and someone who takes responsibility for boosting team morale. The conscientiousness rating is slightly lower than extraversion because they also mention being more of a big-picture person and not always focusing on the minutiae.
