Extraversion: 2.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual appears to be introverted, as they often mention being quiet, reserved, and uncomfortable in social situations. They prefer not to be the center of attention and are more likely to assume a listening role in group discussions. This leads to a low extraversion rating.

On the other hand, the individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness. They pay close attention to details, are a perfectionist, and are not impulsive when it comes to making decisions. They also show a willingness to push themselves harder when faced with challenging tasks and take responsibility for their work. This leads to a high conscientiousness rating.
