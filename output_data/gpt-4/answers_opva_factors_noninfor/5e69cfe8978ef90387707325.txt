Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The individual seems to have a moderate level of extraversion, as they are willing to help others and engage in social situations, but also express some discomfort in larger group settings. They also seem to have a slightly above-average level of conscientiousness, as they are attentive to details, willing to take responsibility, and show concern for their coworkers. However, there are instances where they mention not being able to complete certain tasks or feeling overwhelmed, which may slightly lower their conscientiousness score.
