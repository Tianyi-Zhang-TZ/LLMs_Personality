Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a relatively high level of conscientiousness, as they seem to be responsible, organized, and attentive to details in various situations (e.g., retail job, volunteering at a food pantry). They also show a strong sense of duty and adherence to their beliefs (e.g., not attending a social event due to religious reasons).

However, their extraversion score is lower, as they appear to be less comfortable in social situations where they do not know anyone (e.g., wedding) and may not be as outgoing or assertive in group discussions. They do show some willingness to support and motivate others (e.g., high school competition), but overall, their extraversion is not as strong as their conscientiousness.
