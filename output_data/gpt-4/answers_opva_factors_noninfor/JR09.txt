Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual demonstrates a good level of conscientiousness by showing attention to detail, taking responsibility for their work, and making an effort to clean up after themselves. However, their extraversion score is slightly lower as they describe themselves as shy in social situations and sometimes hesitant to take the lead in group discussions. They do show some willingness to work on their shyness and engage with others, which is why their extraversion score is not too low.
