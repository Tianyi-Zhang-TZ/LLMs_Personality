Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual seems to have a moderate level of conscientiousness, as they mention paying attention to details, working hard, and taking responsibility for tasks. However, their responses are not consistently clear or detailed, which makes it difficult to assess their level of conscientiousness more accurately.

In terms of extraversion, the individual seems to be somewhat introverted. They mention feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone and seem to prefer focusing on tasks and responsibilities rather than engaging in social activities. However, they do mention making an effort to make friends and attending social events, which suggests they are not entirely introverted.
