Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness as they show attention to detail, tidiness, and a willingness to help others in their group. They also consider the importance of tasks and their own abilities before deciding to push themselves or pass the task to someone more prepared. However, they also mention their tendency to multitask and sometimes miss small details, which is why the rating is not a perfect 5.

In terms of extraversion, the individual is generally outgoing and comfortable in social settings, even when they don't know anyone. They also show adaptability in group discussions, taking on a leading or listening role depending on their knowledge of the topic. However, they express a preference for avoiding after-work social events and separating their social and productive time, which indicates a slightly lower level of extraversion.
