Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 2.0

The individual seems to have a somewhat introverted personality, as they mentioned feeling uncomfortable in large social settings and preferring to be around one or two people. However, they also mentioned being a good listener and trying to uplift others when they are feeling down, which shows some level of extraversion. Therefore, I would rate their extraversion as 2.5.

Regarding conscientiousness, the individual mentioned being lazy or disorganized when returning equipment, not paying full attention to details, and sometimes daydreaming more than actually doing the work. These traits suggest a lower level of conscientiousness, so I would rate them as a 2.0.
