Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a moderate level of conscientiousness, as they show attention to detail in certain situations (e.g., assembling a crib for their child) and a willingness to take on responsibilities (e.g., participating in a county accounting board). However, they also exhibit instances where they pass tasks to others (e.g., scrubbing the call list) and act impulsively (e.g., taking a lead that wasn't theirs). 

In terms of extraversion, the individual leans more towards introversion. They describe themselves as introverted and uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone (e.g., attending a networking event alone). They also tend to avoid after-work social events due to personal responsibilities and a preference for spending time at home. However, they do show some extraverted traits, such as being a "life of the party" in certain situations and taking on leadership roles in work settings. Overall, their extraversion rating is slightly below average.
