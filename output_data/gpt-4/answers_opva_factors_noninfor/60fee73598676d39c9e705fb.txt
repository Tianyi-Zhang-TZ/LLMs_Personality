They tend to take on listening roles in group discussions and may feel uncomfortable in social settings where they don't know anyone. However, they do push themselves to attend social events and engage with others, which is why their extraversion rating is not at the lowest end of the scale.

They consistently make efforts to complete tasks to the best of their ability, even when they are challenging or tedious. They also show concern for their coworkers and the impression they make on others, which contributes to their high conscientiousness rating.
