Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, organization, and desire to complete tasks correctly. They also show a strong sense of responsibility and a willingness to ask for help when needed. However, their extraversion rating is lower, as they express feelings of unease and shyness in social situations, especially when they don't know the people involved. They prefer to be a listener rather than a leader in group discussions and are more likely to skip social events if they don't have a close friend attending.
