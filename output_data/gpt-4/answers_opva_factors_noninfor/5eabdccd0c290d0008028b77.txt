Extraversion: 2.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The individual seems to be more introverted, as they mentioned feeling uncomfortable in social settings where they didn't know anyone and preferring to skip after-work social events. However, they did show some willingness to engage in group discussions and raise the spirits of their team members, which is why the rating is not at the lowest level.

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual demonstrated a moderate level of responsibility and organization. They mentioned putting equipment back in place and paying attention to details to avoid making mistakes. They also showed some self-restraint when wanting something badly at work. However, some of their responses were unclear or unrelated to the question, which makes it difficult to give a higher rating for conscientiousness.
