Extraversion: 2.0
Conscientiousness: 4.5

The individual seems to be quite introverted, as they often mention being shy and reserved in social situations, preferring to focus on listening and observing rather than actively participating. They also tend to avoid large social gatherings and feel more comfortable in smaller, familiar groups. This leads to a lower extraversion rating.

On the other hand, the individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness. They pay strong attention to detail, are diligent in completing tasks, and prioritize their work over personal impulses. They also show empathy towards their team members and are willing to help when needed. This leads to a higher conscientiousness rating.
