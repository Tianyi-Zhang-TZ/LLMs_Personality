Extraversion: 4.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual demonstrates a high level of extraversion, as they enjoy socializing, meeting new people, and participating in group discussions. They are confident in their conversational skills and feel comfortable in unfamiliar social settings. Their conscientiousness is also quite high, as they value organization, cleanliness, and attention to detail. They are willing to take on challenging tasks and work through them without seeking help unless absolutely necessary. However, they may not always be as proactive in raising the spirits of their team members, which slightly lowers their conscientiousness score.
