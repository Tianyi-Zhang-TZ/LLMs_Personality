Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The person seems to have a moderate level of extraversion, as they are able to engage in social situations and take on leading roles when necessary, but also tend to feel uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and may prefer to keep things light and not too serious. Their conscientiousness appears to be slightly above average, as they are willing to push themselves in challenging situations, pay attention to details, and try to raise the spirits of their team members. However, they also mentioned feeling overwhelmed and frustrated at times, which may indicate some room for improvement in this area.
