Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual seems to be more introverted, as they tend to be quiet in social settings and prefer to skip after-work events to maintain a work-life balance (Question 1 and 5). However, they do show some willingness to engage in group discussions and support their team members, albeit not as enthusiastically as a highly extraverted person might (Question 3 and 7).

In terms of conscientiousness, the individual appears to be quite organized and detail-oriented, as they make an effort to put things back in place after using them and pay attention to details in their work (Question 2 and 6). They also demonstrate a strong work ethic and dedication to their tasks, even when faced with challenges (Question 4). However, they may not be as proactive in raising team morale, which slightly lowers their conscientiousness score (Question 7).
