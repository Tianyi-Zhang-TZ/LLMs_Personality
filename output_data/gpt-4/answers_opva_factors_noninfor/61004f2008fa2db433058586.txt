They show a strong sense of responsibility and respect for others, as seen in their gym example and their work in the student-run organization. They also exhibit determination and persistence when faced with challenges, such as securing an internship during the pandemic.

In terms of extraversion, the individual is quite outgoing and sociable, as evidenced by their ability to network and engage with others in various social settings, such as the business fraternity recruitment and the after-work happy hour.
