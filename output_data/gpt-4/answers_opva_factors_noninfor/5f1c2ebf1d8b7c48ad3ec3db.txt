Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 4.0

The individual seems to have a moderate level of conscientiousness, as they pay attention to details when necessary (e.g., administering medications) and try to put things back in their place (e.g., the vacuum cleaner incident). However, they also mention instances where they may not be as conscientious, such as feeling anxious when trying to fix something they were nosy about.

The individual appears to be quite extraverted, as they are comfortable mingling in social settings where they don't know anyone, enjoy after-work social events, and take on the role of raising team members' spirits. They also mention being a good listener in group discussions, which is another aspect of extraversion.
