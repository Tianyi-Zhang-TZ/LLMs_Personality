The person seems to have a moderate level of extraversion, as they are generally outgoing and enjoy social events, but also tend to be introverted in certain situations. They are able to adapt their behavior based on the context and their level of familiarity with the subject matter. This is why I gave them a 3.5 rating for extraversion.
