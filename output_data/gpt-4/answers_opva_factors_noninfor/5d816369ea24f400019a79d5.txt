Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual shows a high level of conscientiousness as they prioritize tasks that require attention to detail, are hard-working, and show commitment to their job. They also demonstrate responsibility and are detail-oriented. However, their level of extraversion is moderate, as they feel uncomfortable in social settings with people they don't know. They prefer to survey the situation first before branching out and meeting new people. They also weigh the benefits of after-work events based on whether they are beneficial for the company or team and may skip them if they do not see the value in attending.
