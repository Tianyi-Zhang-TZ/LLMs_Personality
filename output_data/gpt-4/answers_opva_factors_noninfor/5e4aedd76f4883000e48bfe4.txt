Extraversion: 2.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual seems to be more introverted, as they often prefer to listen and observe in social situations rather than taking the lead (e.g., group discussions, after-work events). They also mentioned not being interested in networking at the convention. However, they do show a high level of conscientiousness, as they pay attention to details, clean and put away equipment properly, and take on challenging tasks when necessary. They also demonstrated a willingness to raise team morale when they felt it was in their best interest.
