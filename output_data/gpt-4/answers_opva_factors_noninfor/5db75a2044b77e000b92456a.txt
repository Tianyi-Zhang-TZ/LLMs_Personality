Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

The individual demonstrates a relatively high level of conscientiousness, as they show thoughtfulness in putting away equipment, paying attention to details, and being aware of the needs of their team members. They also exhibit determination and a willingness to push themselves when faced with challenging tasks. However, they also mention being stubborn and prideful in some situations, which may slightly lower their conscientiousness score.

In terms of extraversion, the individual seems to be moderately outgoing and adaptable in social situations, as they try to fit in and act like others when they don't know anyone. They also show a willingness to participate in after-work social events and actively encourage others to join group discussions. However, they also mention being more reserved and cautious in certain situations, such as when they want something badly at work, which suggests that their extraversion may not be consistently high.
