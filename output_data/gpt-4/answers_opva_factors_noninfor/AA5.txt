Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

The individual seems to be quite conscientious, as they mentioned being diligent, goal-oriented, and attentive to details in their work. They also expressed feelings of guilt when they thought about taking something from their workplace without permission. However, they may not be at the highest level of conscientiousness, as they did not provide examples of consistently going above and beyond in all situations.

In terms of extraversion, the individual appears to be somewhat outgoing and comfortable in social situations, as they mentioned overcoming initial discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and taking on a leading role in group discussions. They also mentioned trying to raise the spirits of their team members when they were feeling down. However, they also mentioned instances where they felt uncomfortable or hesitant in social situations, such as attending an after-work event with colleagues they had a bad relationship with. This suggests that their level of extraversion may not be extremely high, but they are still relatively outgoing and sociable.
