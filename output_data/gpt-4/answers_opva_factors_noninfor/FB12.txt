Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual seems to be quite conscientious, as they mention being tidy, paying attention to details, and taking pride in their work. They also show support for their colleagues and tend to be patient in their approach. However, their extraversion score is lower, as they describe themselves as shy, preferring to listen rather than lead in group discussions, and feeling uncomfortable in after-work social events.
