Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a relatively high level of conscientiousness, as they often mention being detail-oriented, focused, and considerate of others in various situations (e.g., cleaning up their work area, pushing themselves to complete challenging tasks, and not acting impulsively at the expense of others). However, their extraversion rating is lower, as they describe themselves as more withdrawn in social situations, preferring to listen rather than lead in group discussions, and sometimes skipping work social events. They do show some willingness to engage with others and provide support, but overall, their extraversion level appears to be on the lower side.
