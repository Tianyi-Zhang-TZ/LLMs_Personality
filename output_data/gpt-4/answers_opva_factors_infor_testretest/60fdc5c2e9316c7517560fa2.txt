Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

The individual seems to be quite conscientious, as they pay attention to details, take responsibility for tasks, and follow procedures. They also appear to be moderately extroverted, as they engage in conversations, express themselves, and show some concern for others' feelings. However, they also mention being cautious and fluctuating in group discussions, which indicates that their extraversion may not be as strong as their conscientiousness.
