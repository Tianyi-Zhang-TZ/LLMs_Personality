Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.0

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness, as they consistently mention their attention to detail, desire to complete tasks correctly, and willingness to help others with their work. They also show restraint in situations where acting impulsively may not be the best course of action.

On the other hand, their extraversion rating is lower due to their preference for staying in the background, avoiding social events, and feeling uncomfortable in group discussions. They do show some willingness to help raise the spirits of their coworkers, but overall, they lean more towards introversion.
