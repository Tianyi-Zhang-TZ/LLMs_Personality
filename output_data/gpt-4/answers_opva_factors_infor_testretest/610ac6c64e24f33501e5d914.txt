Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, desire to keep their workspace organized, and willingness to take on challenging tasks without passing them off to others. They also show restraint in acting on impulses, which further indicates a conscientious nature.

In terms of extraversion, the individual appears to be more introverted, as they describe themselves as shy, anxious around people, and preferring to stay home rather than attend social events. However, they do show some willingness to engage in group discussions and support their team members when they are feeling down, which is why the rating is not at the lowest end of the scale.
