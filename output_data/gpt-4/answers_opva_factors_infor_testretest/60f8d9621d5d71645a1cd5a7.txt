Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a relatively high level of conscientiousness, as they consistently mention taking responsibility for tasks, paying attention to details, and not wanting to give up on challenging tasks. They also show a methodical approach to decision-making and a desire to help others when needed.

However, their extraversion rating is lower, as they express discomfort in social situations where they don't know anyone, tend to skip after-work social events, and prefer to take a listening role in group discussions. They do show some willingness to raise the spirits of team members and engage in conversation, but overall, their extraversion level is not as high as their conscientiousness.
