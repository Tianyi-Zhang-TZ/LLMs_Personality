Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a relatively high level of conscientiousness, as they pay attention to details, prefer challenges, and are careful not to act impulsively. They also show concern for others and put things back in place at work. However, their extraversion score is lower, as they tend to be shy and uncomfortable in social settings, prefer not to attend after-work events, and take a more passive role in group discussions. They do show some extraverted traits, such as trying to raise team members' spirits and being optimistic, but overall, they lean more towards introversion.
