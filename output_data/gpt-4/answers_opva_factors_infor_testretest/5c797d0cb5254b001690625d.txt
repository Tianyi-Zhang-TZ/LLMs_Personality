Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 4.0

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their commitment to teamwork, attention to detail, and preference for thoughtful decision-making over impulsive actions. They also show a strong sense of responsibility in completing tasks and maintaining a positive work environment.

The individual also displays a good level of extraversion, as they are comfortable in social situations, able to form connections quickly, and use humor to uplift others. They actively participate in group discussions and enjoy spending time with coworkers outside of work. However, their extraversion may not be as high as their conscientiousness, as they seem to place a stronger emphasis on their work performance and responsibilities.
