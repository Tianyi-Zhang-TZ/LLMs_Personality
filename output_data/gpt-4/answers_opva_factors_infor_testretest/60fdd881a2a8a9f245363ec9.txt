Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness in their responses, as they consistently show a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a desire to challenge themselves. They take pride in their work and strive to do things correctly, even under pressure.

In contrast, their extraversion score is lower, as they describe themselves as socially awkward and anxious in social situations. They tend to stick to their close personal group and avoid making a fuss. However, they do show some willingness to step out of their comfort zone and engage with others when necessary, which prevents their extraversion score from being too low.
