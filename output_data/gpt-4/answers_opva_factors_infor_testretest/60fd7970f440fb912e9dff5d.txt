Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.0

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, commitment to completing tasks, and taking responsibility for their work. They consistently mention being detail-oriented, tenacious, and not leaving tasks aside just because they are difficult. This indicates a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to their work.

On the other hand, the individual scores low on extraversion. They describe themselves as introverted, feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone, and generally taking on a listening role in group discussions. They also mention feeling anxious when trying to cheer up team members, which suggests that they may not be as comfortable or skilled in social interactions as someone with a higher extraversion score.
