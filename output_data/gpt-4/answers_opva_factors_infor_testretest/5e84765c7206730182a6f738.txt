Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.0

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, determination to complete tasks, and consideration for others' needs and resources. They consistently prioritize their work and responsibilities, and are careful not to act impulsively.

On the other hand, the individual scores low on extraversion as they prefer to assume a listening role in group discussions, avoid after-work social events, and feel more comfortable when others initiate conversations. They do show some concern for their team members' well-being, but overall, their introverted nature is more prominent.
