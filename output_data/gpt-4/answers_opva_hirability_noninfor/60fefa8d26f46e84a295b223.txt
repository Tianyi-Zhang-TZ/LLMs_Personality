The interviewee demonstrated a decent level of communication flexibility, as they were able to adapt their communication style in different situations, such as approaching strangers in a social setting or participating in group discussions. However, their persuasiveness could use some improvement, as they did not provide strong examples of convincing others or using well-considered arguments. The candidate showed a strong quality orientation, as they were attentive to details and focused on following protocols at work.
