The interviewee demonstrated a decent level of communication flexibility, as they were able to adapt to different situations and engage with others. However, their persuasiveness could use some improvement, as their answers did not always convey a strong sense of personal authority or diplomacy. The candidate showed a strong quality orientation, as they mentioned paying attention to detail and striving for high-quality work.
