The candidate demonstrated a decent level of communication flexibility, as they were able to adapt to different social situations and express themselves accordingly. However, their persuasiveness was not as strong, as they seemed to be more of a listener than a leader in group discussions. The candidate showed a strong quality orientation, as they mentioned their focus on being organized and detail-oriented. They also displayed a good development orientation, as they were willing to challenge themselves and step out of their comfort zone.
