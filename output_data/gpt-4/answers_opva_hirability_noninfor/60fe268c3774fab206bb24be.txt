The interviewee demonstrated some communication flexibility, as they were able to describe different situations and their personality in each.

Their persuasiveness was not strongly demonstrated, as they did not provide many examples of convincing others or using well-considered arguments. The interviewee showed a decent quality orientation, as they mentioned paying attention to details and helping others in certain situations. Their development orientation was also fairly good, as they discussed pushing themselves to overcome challenges and learn from them.
