Conscientiousness: 4.2 
The participant in general exhibits a fairly high degree of conscientiousness. From the responses, it's apparent that they tend to put things back in their place after usage, push themselves when challenged and pay careful attention to detail in order to avoid mistakes. They also acted with a sense of ambition to get a raise at work. However, while these indicate a high conscientiousness score, their level of anxiety and worry may suggest that there is room for growth in managing their emotions related to responsibilities at work.

Extraversion: 2.5 
On extraversion, the respondent tends to be less comfortable in social settings where they do not know people, they are also less inclined to attend after-work social events and when their team members were feeling down, they attempted to uplift them but with some level of discomfort. However, they managed to pull through in situations where their role was important, such as a group discussion or a work presentation. Hence, the mixed responses suggest that while the participant may not be overtly outgoing or comfortable in all social situations, they are capable of navigating them when necessary, indicating a moderate level of extraversion.
