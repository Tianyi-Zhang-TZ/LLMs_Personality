Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 3.5

Reason:
The individual exhibits a high level of Conscientiousness, as indicated by their meticulous nature and attention to detail in order to avoid mistakes (evident from answers to questions 2, 4, and 6). They persistently push themselves when confronted with challenges and are thoughtful about their actions, showing less impulsivity, which is a common trait of conscientious people (shown in question 4 and 8). 

In terms of Extraversion, the person seems to be somewhere in the middle. They seem somewhat shy and reserved and prefer a listener's role in group discussions (Question 3). However, they also express the willingness to engage in social activities with coworkers (Question 5), and an inclination to help uplift others' spirits in a team setting (Question 7). This combination suggests a moderate level of extraversion.
