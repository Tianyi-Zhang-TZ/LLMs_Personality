This is evident when he describes his behavior at social gatherings, where he prefers to observe and keep to himself until approached. He tends to assume a listener rather than a leadership role in group discussions, further pointing towards a more introverted nature. Even in situations where he could have boosted team members' spirits, he chose an empathetic and quiet approach over a more active and outgoing one.
