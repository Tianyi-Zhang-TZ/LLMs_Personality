Conscientiousness: 4.8 
The person provided multiple instances to demonstrate high Conscientiousness such as taking responsibility of cleaning and organizing menus, pushing oneself harder to stay in the preferred major despite low grades, and taking care of details to avoid mistakes in complex civil engineering problems. Also, her reluctance to act impulsively at work to get something badly she wanted again reflects a high level of thoughtfulness, orderliness, and discipline, which are the hallmarks of Conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 4.6 
The person showed high level of enthusiastic engagement with the social world such as being comfortable and thriving in meeting and talking to new people at college, assuming a listening and leading role in a group discussion at her engineering class, joining after-work social event to get to know colleagues better, and lifting team members' spirits during challenging times. This indicates high level of extraversion as she is always eager and excited to engage with people, even in uncomfortable or challenging situations. But she did also express a note of caution that getting too comfortable with just one person might prevent her from branching out, hence the slight reduction from a full score.
