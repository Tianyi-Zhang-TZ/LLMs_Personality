Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.4

The person seems to have a high level of conscientiousness. They display a sense of responsibility and foresight in making decisions, as seen in their answers to Questions 2, 4, 6, and 8 by discussing the importance of cleaning and maintaining equipment at work, attempting to perfect tasks even when they are challenging, paying attention to details in tasks, and not acting impulsively even when they want something badly at work.

Regarding extraversion, the person appears moderately extroverted. Their comfort level in social situations can waver depending on the situation, as indicated in their responses to Questions 1, 3, 5, and 7. While they express some enjoyment and understand the benefits of attending social events (Q5) and in certain cases, they assume a proactive role in group discussions (Q3), they also express feelings of discomfort and insecurity when placed in a new social environment (Q1) and could not remember specifically uplifting team members who were feeling down (Q7). This suggests a bit more variability in their level of extraversion.
