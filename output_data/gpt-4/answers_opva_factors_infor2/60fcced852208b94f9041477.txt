Conscientiousness: 4.5 

The interviewee demonstrates a high degree of conscientiousness throughout the conversation. She expresses being systematic and disciplined, putting things in place at the end of the day and paying attention to detail even if it's stressful at times. She also shows signs of being thoughtful and careful in making decisions, rather than acting on impulse. However, she admits that the meticulousness required in some tasks can lead to stress and anxiety, and sometimes she needs to ask for help, which slightly lowers the score.

Extraversion: 3.5 

In terms of extraversion, it's a little more mixed. On the one hand, she shares that she can take on leadership roles, effectively participates in group discussions, and makes the effort to uplift team members' spirits, signalling a comfortable interaction with people. On the other hand, she also talks about regularly feeling self-conscious and needing help with her generalized anxiety. Also, she seems to prefer solitary time after work, but occasionally pushes herself to participate in social events. This combination of traits suggests a mid-range extraversion score.
