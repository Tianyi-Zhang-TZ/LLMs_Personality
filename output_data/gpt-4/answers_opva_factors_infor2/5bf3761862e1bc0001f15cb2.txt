Conscientiousness: 4.7 
Extraversion: 1.8 

This person scores high in conscientiousness due to their meticulous attention to detail, high level of responsibility, perfectionism, and cautious nature. They repeatedly talk about not wanting to be a bother to other people, putting things back in place, and even feeling obligated to finish tasks despite them being difficult. Their conscientiousness is shown through their careful consideration and execution of tasks, showing a diligent and organized nature. 

On the other hand, their score for extraversion is low due to their self-proclaimed introverted nature. They express feeling very nervous, uncomfortable, and drained in social settings, particularly when they do not know anyone else. They describe themselves as preferring listening roles rather than leading ones, and try to avoid after-work socialization or any situation that requires them to be the center of attention. This person might, however, show empathy toward others as they tend to absorb other's emotions and try to raise their spirit suggesting a certain degree of sociability, but overall, they lean strongly towards introversion.
