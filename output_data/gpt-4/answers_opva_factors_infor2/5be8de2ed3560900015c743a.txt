Conscientiousness: 3.9
The individual shows high levels of conscientiousness throughout their experiences. In their answers, they detail times of navigating stressful periods with diligence and careful planning, where attention to detail and the desire to do a job well have been significant driving factors. They have demonstrated that they are generally well-organized, responsible, and reliable, taking on tasks and seeing them through to completion. However, there were a few instances, such as impulsively deciding to travel to Turkey, that pulls back their score slightly.

Extraversion: 4.3 
The individual leans toward extraversion based on their self-described comfort in social settings, their willingness to take a leadership role in group settings, and their natural desire to engage with others during networking events, despite difficulties. They were open about their emotional experiences, another typical feature of extraversion. They show a strong tendency towards empathy and taking on leading roles where they can help and encourage others. However, they also acknowledge being less comfortable in purely social situations without clear goals, which keeps the score slightly off from the maximum.
