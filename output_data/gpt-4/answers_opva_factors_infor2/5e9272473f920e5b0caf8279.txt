Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.5 

Conscientiousness was rated highly due to the respondent's consistent patterns of responsibility and diligence. They regularly demonstrate a sense of duty, accomplishing tasks even under challenging circumstances (booking alternate flights for the cancelled one, taking care of equipment at work, etc.), as well as displaying great attention to detail in their work, which was particularly demonstrated in the data entry job. There seems to be a strong tendency towards meticulousness and structured behaviour which indicates high Conscientiousness.

In terms of Extraversion, the score was lower because the respondent appears to be more comfortable in quieter, less social situations, and they largely prefer to listen rather than lead group discussions. There is an avoidance of work social events, and while they can interact and meet new people when necessary, the preference leans towards more personal or one-on-one communication. They do show empathy towards coworkers though, which adds to the score. Nevertheless, their social tendencies display characteristics more aligned with introversion than extroversion, hence a lower score was given.
