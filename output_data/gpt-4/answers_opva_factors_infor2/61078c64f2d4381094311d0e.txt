Conscientiousness: 3.8
Extraversion: 2.2

The individual demonstrated conscientiousness in their responses. They express a keenness to follow protocols at work, such as cleaning up equipment, completing detail-oriented tasks carefully, and striving to be independent and take on challenges. They also show self-discipline and consistently make efforts to accomplish what's needed in various situations, which shows the dutiful aspect within the Conscientiousness trait. 
However, the score isn't higher due to occasional impulsiveness and lacking a little in team spirit (For example, in the last scenario, the person tends towards selfishness going to get what they want, even if it looks like a kind act on the surface).

For extraversion, the individual seems to be introverted, from feeling nervous in social situations (question 1 and 5), to being reserved when partaking in group discussions. Yet, the score isn't too low because they do show the effort to brighten other people's spirits and make them feel welcome and engaged and takes a lead in group settings after acclimating (questions 3 and 7). Despite being uncomfortable in social and outgoing situations, they are willing to step up and play their role. This combination of factors factors into a modest score for Extraversion.
