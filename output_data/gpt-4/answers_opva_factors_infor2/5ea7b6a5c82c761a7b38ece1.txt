Conscientiousness: 4.4
Extraversion: 1.6

The subject demonstrated conscientiousness through behavior such as attention to details, trying to avoid mistakes, and has an inclination to be ambitious and an over-achiever when it comes to promotions or highly valued targets. Their responses indicate that they have a keen sense of responsibility and organization. However, their struggle with unfamiliarity or unclear scenarios hint at some flexibility, thus not a perfect 5.

The low score in Extraversion is due to the subject's consistent expression of social anxiety, discomfort in social settings, preference for listening role versus a leading one, and tendency to turn down social events after work. These all suggest that the subject is introverted, but they have shown some effort to interact (e.g., talking to team members when they are down), indicating they're not entirely closed off, hence the score is not the lowest possible.
