Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.5 

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness, as indicated by their attention to detail in their work, their reliability, their ability to stick to schedules and deadlines, and their strong sense of duty and responsibility. They've expressed their desire to correct mess, keep things in order, and pay attention to minor details, all of which demonstrate their conscientiousness. 

On the other hand, the individual seems moderately introverted with some occasional leanings towards extraversion. They've indicated that they often prefer solitude or silence, and that they feel drained after social interactions. They also show a preference for thinking over speaking, and a tendency to be 'in their head' rather than in the present moment with others. However, they have the ability to take charge in certain situations and have shown empathy towards others' feelings, which implies they aren't strictly introverted. While they've demonstrated some extraverted traits, mainly they appear introverted tendencies, hence the lower score in extraversion.
