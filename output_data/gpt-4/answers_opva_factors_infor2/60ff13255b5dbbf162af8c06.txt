Conscientiousness: 4.7
The individual's responses express a high level of conscientiousness. They appear to be driven, enjoy organization, attention to detail and prefer structured environments where expectations are clear. This is evident in their responses, particularly in question 4, where they express a struggle, but also a determination, in acquiring knowledge to confidently execute their role and in question 6, where they disclose a specific intensity and enjoyment in detail-oriented tasks. They also exhibit a struggle with impulse control (question 8), which is a facet of conscientiousness, but this trait also shows the ability to self-reflect and indicating they are working on this area. 

Extraversion: 3.8
The individual exhibits a mix of extraversion and introverted traits. The responses showcase comfort in socializing and interacting with others, especially in a work setting, but it also reveals a desire for personal time and a propensity to feel uncomfortable being the center of attention (question 1). They demonstrate strong listening skills rather than consistently aiming to be the lead voice (question 3) and express hesitation about attending social events (question 5). However, their actions of encouraging team spirit when teammates are feeling low demonstrate approachability and a capacity for empathy, both falling under the umbrella of extraversion (question 7). Therefore, the rating leans towards the higher end of the scale due to these displayed traits.
