Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 3.7

Reasoning:

For Conscientiousness, the person's responses reveal a high attention to detail, they are organized, loyal, diligent and are often fully involved in their tasks. They are not afraid to push beyond their comfort zone (as in the marathon example) and are willing to meet challenges head on. These characteristics suggest a high degree of Conscientiousness. 

For Extraversion, the responses show an outgoing, social personality but also reveal some areas of hesitation. The person frequently takes the opportunity to interact with others, such as when coaching or attending social events. However, they also seem somewhat reserved in group work or social settings, preferring to listen more than to speak. This indicates they are not utterly dominant or always seeking attention, which prevents a full score for Extroversion.
