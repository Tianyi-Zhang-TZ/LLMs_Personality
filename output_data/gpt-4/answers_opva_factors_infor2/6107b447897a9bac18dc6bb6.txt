Conscientiousness: 3.7
Overall, this individual's conscientiousness shows that he has some level of organization and reliability. He always seems to follow rules and protocols at work and tries to pay attention to details when necessary, although can get anxious about it. While often hesitant and worried about making mistakes or not doing a task perfectly, he will ultimately step aside and seek help when necessary.

Extraversion: 2.2
The individual is generally shy, often feeling uncomfortable in social situations especially with unfamiliar people. Although he was willing to take up a leadership role in the group project when others did not step in and appeared to cope under the circumstances, he generally tends to avoid stepping out of his comfort zone and is not typically assertive. Despite his discomfort, he does demonstrate some level of sociability when engaging with his known friends or coworkers in social events. But his general tendency toward introversion, timidity, and preferring his comfort zone seems to dominate.
