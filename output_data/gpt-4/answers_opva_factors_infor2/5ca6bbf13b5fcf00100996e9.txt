They also mentioned the tendency to take collective action, showing concern for tasks that benefit the group. 

On the Extraversion scale, the person is harder to rate as their responses seemed to fluctuate. The person shows a fairly decent level of comfort in initiating conversation in unfamiliar places or in taking the lead in meetings when needed.

Equality between extraversion and introversion manifests in their answers, leading to a more moderate score.
