Extraversion: 2.5
The individual seems to have a neutral to low level of Extraversion. They often chose to listen rather than take on the role of a speaker in group discussions and seemed comfortable with that. When in a social setting where the individual didn't know anyone, they decided to keep more to themselves rather than socialising. Also, their preference for joining after-work events depended on the closeness of the relationship with the people who were inviting them, indicating selective socialising. However, they were happy to take on a morale-raising role in a group when necessary, evidencing some capacity for group engagement when the situation demanded. This indicates a certain balance, but with a tilt towards introversion, hence the slightly lower score.
