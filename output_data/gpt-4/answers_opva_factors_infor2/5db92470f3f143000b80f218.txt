Conscientiousness: 4.6
Extraversion: 3.2

The individual's high conscientiousness rating is grounded in their response to being thorough, careful, orderly, and diligent. They often strive to improve in their work, demonstrating great responsibility, and are also willing to overcome challenging tasks, priding themselves on doing things 'their way'. They also mention how they stay organized and crave structure, which further underlines their high Conscientiousness score.

Their Extraversion, however, is more moderate. While they do often indicate a willingness to engage in social interactions, they also frequently mention their shyness or preference for reserved, quiet time. Their choice to attend or avoid social gatherings varies greatly based on the circumstances, showing that although they can engage well in social situations, they are not necessarily driven by the need for social interactions. They are somewhat comfortable with taking a leadership role in group work when required, but they also value time to themselves or one-on-one interaction, demonstrating that their level of Extraversion is more balanced.
