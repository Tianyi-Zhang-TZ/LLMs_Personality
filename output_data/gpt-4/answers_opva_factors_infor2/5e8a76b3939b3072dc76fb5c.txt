Conscientiousness: 3.6
Extraversion: 2.2

When rating the conscientiousness aspect, the person shows a good sense of responsibility and seems to be relatively diligent, often referring to cooperating with others to complete tasks and ensure things are done properly, and even mentions the effort to avoid making mistakes (question 6). The person displays tendencies of being orderly and dependable (question 2), and when faced with challenging tasks (question 4), they choose to push harder instead of leaving it aside. However, there are moments where the person chooses to leave tasks thinking it's more trouble than it's worth which reflects some flakiness, and hence the person does not have a very high score in conscientiousness, but a fairly balanced one.

In regards to extraversion, the person consistently indicates they are more introverted in nature. They often choose to stay in the background during social occurrences (question 1, question 3), but still try to connect with others (question 2). For instance, in question 5, the person opts to go to a social event with the motive of getting along better with co-workers, which indicates some effort to get out of their comfort zone. However overall, the person seems to be relatively less outgoing and energetic, which results in a lower extraversion rating compared to conscientiousness.
