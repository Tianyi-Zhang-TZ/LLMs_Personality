Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their actions and remarks. They expressed a tendency to endeavor to do tasks to the best of their ability, often going above and beyond as evidenced in the Microsoft example. Their attention to detail and the importance they place on keeping things organized also highlight this trait. However, there's still a bit room for improvement as they mentioned about acting impulsively under severe stress.

Extraversion: 3.5
There are clear indications of extraversion in the individual's personality, such as their enthusiasm to introduce themselves to strangers in new environments and taking the lead in group discussions. However, they also expressed a preference for listening rather than leading in some group situations and usually choose to avoid after-work social events due to anxiety. Additionally, they appear to have a strong sense of supportiveness towards their team, but this is more introverted than it is extraverted as it involves one-on-one contact rather than group interaction. This combination implies a somewhat balanced personality between extraversion and introversion.
