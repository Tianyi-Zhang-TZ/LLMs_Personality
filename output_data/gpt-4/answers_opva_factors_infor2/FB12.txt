Conscientiousness: 4.4
Extraversion: 2.2

Reasoning: 
For conscientiousness, the respondent demonstrated a strong commitment to completing their tasks, paying great attention to detail, being tidy and organized, and showing patience at work. They also displayed a consistent willingness to take on tough challenges rather than passing them onto others. These are typical traits of a highly conscientious individual. I rate it a 4.4 as there is room for improvement in stress management but overall it's quite high.

In contrast, the extraversion score is lower because, while the person seems to be willing to be supportive to colleagues and tries to get to know others, they are generally uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings, tends to be a listener than a leader in group discussions, and prefers to skip social activities with colleagues. They tend to be on the shyer and respectful side which results in a lower score for extraversion. I give a 2.2 for extraversion, indicating that the individual is more introverted.
