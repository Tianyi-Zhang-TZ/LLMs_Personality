Conscientiousness: 4.8
Extraversion: 3.8

The respondent has demonstrated high conscientiousness, as indicated by their attention to detail, systematic planning, and dedication when working on tasks such as the painting job and plumbing issue. They also exhibited self-control when dealing with a difficult customer at work, putting professionalism over personal emotions. 

For extraversion, while the respondent has shown to be capable of interacting with others and even take the initiative to start conversations in unfamiliar environments, they seem to prefer being a listener in group discussions and use humor as a tool to cheer up colleagues. These suggest a moderate level of extraversion, as they are comfortable in social situations but not necessarily the most outgoing or assertive person in the room.
