Conscientiousness: 4.5
The interviewee showcases a high degree of conscientiousness throughout their responses. This is evident in their attention to details, especially when handling dangerous chemicals in the lab. In addition, their own insistence to take on two projects simultaneously during their internship showcases their determination and their moral obligation to fulfill their work to the best of their abilities. Their response to wanting something at work also shows their ability to plan and to avoid acting out of impulse.

Extraversion: 2.5
The interviewee self identifies as a more introverted person who enjoys alone time, suggesting lower levels of extraversion. However, they demonstrate an ability to navigate and adapt to new situations socially, even expressing a degree of ease in being able to start with a "blank slate" in new social circumstances. They also show empathy towards coworkers and are willing to make efforts to raise their spirits, indicating some degree of sociability. But the effort seems to be an undertaking and it's also mentioned in the meet and greet situation which suggests that their natural tendency is towards introversion. Therefore, the rating is more towards the middle given these complex facets of their extraversion personality trait.
