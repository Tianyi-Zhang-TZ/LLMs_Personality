Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.0 

The individual in question displays a high degree of Conscientiousness (rated at 4.5 out of 5). This high conscientiousness can be observed in their tendency to push themselves harder to complete tasks instead of leaving tasks undone or passing them to coworkers. They also prefer to strive to do the job well even if the situation is stressful or difficult. Their meticulous attention to detail and their commitment to keeping things organized and returning equipment to where it belongs further highlights their responsible and diligent personality traits. 

In contrast, the individual's level of extraversion is low (rated at 2.0 out of 5). Given their self-proclaimed shyness, reluctance to take on leadership roles or engage heavily in social situations, and preference for listening rather than talking, they could be regraded as more introverted than extroverted. However, they do make an effort to be personable and engaging when necessary, hence the score is not at the absolute minimum.
