Conscientiousness: 3.7
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual exhibits moderate levels of conscientiousness as he tends to be reliable and puts effort into his tasks, as evident in Questions 2, 4 and 6. He seems to approach his tasks with determination and a sense of responsibility, especially when he expresses frustration when not performing up to his potential (Question 6). In addition, Question 8 shows that he's able to evaluate pros and cons when making decisions, which is characteristic of conscientious individuals. However, his tendency to be easily stressed and uncomfortable when dealing with unfamiliar tasks (Question 2) prevents a higher rating.

On the factor of extraversion, the individual leans more towards the reserved side. Though the person tries to get along with others and attempts to be sociable, as demonstrated in Questions 1, 3, 5, and 7, they seem to express discomfort and awkwardness during social situations, particularly those involving unfamiliar people or circumstances. The individual prefers to maintain a low profile or avoid potential conflicts (Q1, Q3). This person does show some signs of extraversion by trying to liven up the mood at the workplace (Q7), but overall, they seem more introverted.
