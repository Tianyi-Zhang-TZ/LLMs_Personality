Conscientiousness: 4.7 
Extraversion: 4.2 

The individual consistently demonstrated high levels of conscientiousness through their responses. They expressed a diligent approach to their work, as seen in their attention to detail (Question 6), willingness to take on challenges (Question 4), and proactive behaviour towards equipment maintenance (Question 2). They also showed they make thoughtful decisions, avoiding impulsive actions unless beneficial for the group (Question 8). These characteristics suggest a highly conscientious personality. 

Regarding extraversion, the individual also demonstrated high scores. They showed an ability to comfortably interact with strangers (Question 1), possess an openness to engaging in group discussions (Question 3), and actively tried to uplift their team's spirits (Question 7). However, their inclination to skip after-work social events (Question 5) suggests a slight preference for solitude after a day's work, leading to a slightly lower score for extraversion compared to conscientiousness.
