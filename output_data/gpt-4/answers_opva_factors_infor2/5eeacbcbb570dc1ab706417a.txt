Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 4.3 

The rating for Conscientiousness is high because the individual has shown in their responses a thoroughness, carefulness, reliability, and a strong desire to avoid mistakes, particularly in relation to tasks at work and paying meticulous attention to details. Their mention of safety when using chemicals, pushing self for challenging tasks, and not being impulsive in order to achieve what they want at work all provide insights into their high level of conscientiousness.

The rating for Extraversion is also quite high, but not as high as Conscientiousness. The individual does express comfort in talking to strangers to some extent, take part in discussions even as a listener more than a speaker, and attend social events for camaraderie reasons. However, they also express episodes of apparent discomfort or awkwardness in extended social settings. They express a need to make others feel comfortable when they're down, indicating a tendency to be outward and socially concerned. Regardless, they seem to push themselves into these extrovert activities which might possibly indicate this may not come as naturally to them as their conscientious behaviors.
