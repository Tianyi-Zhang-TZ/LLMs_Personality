Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.7

The participant has shown high levels of conscientiousness throughout the answers given. They demonstrate a capacity for detail-oriented work, the tendency to consider multiple solutions before acting, the courage to handle tasks independently, and a strong sense of duty to complete tasks well and keep spaces organized. All these are signs of high conscientiousness. The score isn't quite a 5 due to the mention of occasional frustration and needing to ask for help sometimes.

The extraversion rating is closer to the middle but leaning towards introversion. The participant appears to be somewhat reserved and shy, particularly in unfamiliar social situations. Yet, they also show the capacity to engage in and lead discussions when certain conditions are met, such as having an interesting topic to contribute to or when required to keep the conversation flowing. They also showed willingness to uplift team morale. However, there's a clear preference for thinking things through carefully, which may affect their spontaneity and willingness to engage in every social situation. Hence, this score is somewhat lower than the conscientiousness score.
