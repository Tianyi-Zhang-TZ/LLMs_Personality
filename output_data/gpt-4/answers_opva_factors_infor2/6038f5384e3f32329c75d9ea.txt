Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 4.5

The person scored very high in conscientiousness. As exhibited from the responses, the person thoroughly thinks events through, develops plans, organizes tasks effectively and pursues them with diligence as shown in the tasks of putting away equipment, handling a challenging project and processing a detailed medical order. The fact that the person actively approached a manager for a promotion discussion shows a well-developed sense of duty and ambition, further strengthening the high conscientiousness rating. The individual's willingness to back-check work also signifies a meticulous nature. 

In terms of extraversion, the individual showed a significant level of comfortability in foreign environments, ability to develop contacts and relationships, and overall energetic engagement in social activities. This is evident from their participation in a new leadership event, leading and also actively listening in a group discussion, and taking the initiative to lift team spirits during hard times. However, their discretion about not attending a work outing due to the potential for unprofessional behavior indicates a slightly reserved nature, hence the rating isn't a perfect score.
