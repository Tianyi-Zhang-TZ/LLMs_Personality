Conscientiousness: 4.6 
Extraversion: 3.2

The person describes themselves as very conscientious, diligent, and detail-oriented. They mention having a strong sense of responsibility towards their work and colleagues, demonstrating high regards for rules and organization, like when they took care to return borrowed equipment promptly, or when they persisted in a detail-oriented job. They also seem to show a high degree of self-discipline and aim for goal-oriented success, such as when they persevered to complete a challenging advanced degree, however their self-control regarding acting on impulses to push for personal achievements reduce the potential perfect score.

In terms of extraversion, there are some situations in which this person showed extraverted tendencies and others where they appeared more introverted. They reportedly feel comfortable in leadership roles when needed but also say they can be clearly more comfortable and active as a listener. They reportedly feel nervous in unfamiliar social settings and enjoy their private time, often choosing to stay home rather than attend social work events. This suggests a balance between some extraverted and introverted tendencies, but leaning towards the latter.
