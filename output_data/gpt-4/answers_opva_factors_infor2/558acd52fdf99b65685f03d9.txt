Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The respondent shows a high level of conscientiousness. They like to plan, organize, and complete tasks successfully. Thereâ€™s a clear focus on details and doing things right. They showed signs of being hardworking, diligent, respecting rules and order, and a desire to complete tasks to the best of their ability, like paying attention to details as a housekeeper or sticking with a difficult task to see it through to completion.

In terms of extraversion, the rating is lower. Throughout the answers, it is apparent that the person can be quite reserved and more comfortable in familiar social settings. Though they mention being outgoing, there seem to be conditions to this trait; for instance, only when they are around people they know well. They also acknowledge a tendency towards being a listener rather than a leader in group settings and prefer to maintain a supportive, rather than a dominant role in these scenarios. There is some sociability demonstrated, such as going out for lunch with coworkers, but generally, the individual appears to be somewhat introverted in novel social situations.
