Conscientiousness: 5.0 
Extraversion: 4.2 

The interviewee frequently underscored his dedication to thoroughness, accountability, orderliness, and an analytical approach to his work while answering related questions. This indicates an extremely high conscientiousness level in line with the HEXCO model. 

Regarding extraversion, the interviewee demonstrated considerable sociability, assertiveness, and the ability to interact positively in social environments. However, he also expressed comfort in not joining social events and evaluating social situations before engaging, demonstrating a certain level of introversion. Therefore, he is assessed as high in extraversion, but not at the absolute maximum.
