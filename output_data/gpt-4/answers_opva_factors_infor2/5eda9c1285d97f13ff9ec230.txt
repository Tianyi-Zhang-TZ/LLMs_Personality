Conscientiousness: 3.8
Extraversion: 2.5

To start with Conscientiousness; it's clear the person values hard work, likes to help others, and has a focus on getting things done. They mentioned instances of being dedicated (working through a weekend for a challenging task), caring for others (cleaning up after themselves when they could have left it for someone else), and experience in management. However, the person also admits that they are not meticulous and their workspace isn't the cleanest. All these points indicate they are relatively conscientious, but not the highest possible level - thus a rating of 3.8.

In terms of Extraversion, the person shows more introverted tendencies. They described themselves as an introvert, and while they can adapt and socialize (such as in the movie set situation and in the after-work social event), their preference seems to be towards quieter, more solitary activities. They do appear to have good leadership attributes, taking into account the needs of their teammates and even boosting morale, but still indicated they prefer to lead by example rather than being an out-front charismatic leader. Overall, they are capable of social interactions and in certain situations, they seek them out, but generally, they are more reserved, which results in a lower score of 2.5 for Extraversion.
