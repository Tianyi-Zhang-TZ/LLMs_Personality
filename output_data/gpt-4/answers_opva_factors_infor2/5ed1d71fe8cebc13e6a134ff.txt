Conscientiousness: 4.5 
In the descriptions this person provides, they show a strong commitment to following through on tasks, even when they are difficult or tedious, like their example of the data entry task during their internship. They tend to be well-organized, thorough, and careful to avoid making mistakes. They are responsible and tend to think about the overall benefit of their actions for the team as evidenced by their handling of their work schedules, where they weighed their personal desires against the needs of the team before speaking to their manager.

Extraversion: 4.0 
This person displays considerable but not complete ease in social situations. They understand the necessity of knowing and interacting with other people, as seen in their decision to join social events at the internship, despite initial apprehension due to their young age and lack of familiarity with the others. Also, this person seems capable to assume a balanced role between speaking and listening in group discussions, showing confidence in their communication skills while maintaining others' inputs. However, they also express feeling overwhelmed or anxious in social situations, indicating that they are not completely comfortable being in such environments, thus not a perfect 5.0.
