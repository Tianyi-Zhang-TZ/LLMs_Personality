Conscientiousness: 2.5 
Extraversion: 2.0 

The scores are derived from the discussion provided in each question-answer routinely. The evaluation for both Conscientiousness and Extraversion indicates that the individual may have average or below-average scores relative to a general population.

In terms of Conscientiousness, the participant seems to both have aspects reflecting high and low levels. He gives attention to detail when delivering orders for Uber Eats and prioritizes client satisfaction. However, he avoids doing additional work when feeling tired, like when working for the beer Distribution Company, and when moving heavy furniture, indicating some lack of responsibility and discipline. This leads to a mid-level rating.

For Extraversion, the individual does not seem to lean significantly towards either extreme. While he seems okay with social interactions, often he was more comfortable in a listening role or deciding to skip social events after work due to tiredness. This is seen in the group discussions and the after-work social events scenarios. Thus, the rating is slightly below average.
