Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The person seems highly conscientious; although they express difficulties and make mistakes, the person generally shows a readiness to tackle challenges, seeking to resolve problems through effort and diligence. They primarily strive to respect rules and procedures, especially concerning safety and organization. Their attention to details and their experiences handling tasks based on procedure and order add to their conscientiousness score. They also seem to exhibit personal dedication to their tasks, especially given their tendency to push through complications and their discomfort with not being able to fix issues.

Their extraversion score reflects a balanced position; the person is fairly comfortable being in social situations, particularly when they are in control and can set the social dynamics of the situation. They also seem comfortable speaking up in group discussions and trying to uplift others. However, they do report some reservations about joining social events where they might feel embarrassed or inadequate, showing some avoidance of social situations at times. They also express struggles in expressing empathy, which can be a crucial aspect of interpersonal interactions that is often associated with higher extraversion. This, along with their mixed experiences in social situations, leads to a slightly above-average score in extraversion.
