Conscientiousness: 4.7 
Extraversion: 4.5

The individual has described themselves in various situations that speak towards their high level of conscientiousness and extraversion. From the onset, their conscientiousness is showcased in their attention to detail in tasks involving equipment or due processes at work. Their tendency to organise checks, overlook office tasks and commit extra hours at work shows a high level of dependability. Notably, they showed a dedication to mastering complex work programs despite the challenge they initially presented, further demonstrating their high degree of conscientiousness.

Their extroverted nature is similarly evident in their willingness to take initial steps to socialise in unfamiliar environments and situations such as a new college or work team. They seek to connect with people and are comfortable shifting from listening to a leading role in group discussions as noted in their response to question 3. Their response to question 7, where they initiated efforts to raise team morale during a crisis, also expresses their extroverted predisposition. 

However, they have shown slight hesitations when entering new social situations, possibly indicating some level of introverted characteristics too, hence the score of 4.5 in extraversion.
