Conscientiousness: 4.3
Throughout the answers, the individual exhibits a high level of conscientiousness. They give instances where they tackle challenges head-on, with persistence and a strong desire to complete tasks on their own. For example, when discussing setting up a quickscreen at work, they faced a challenging situation and showed determination to complete it rather than passing it on. The individual also shows orderliness and attention to detail. For example, they enjoy making lists and checking things off. Even when faced with difficulties, like setting up equipment at home, they highlighted their attempts to get things right. However, they also showed impulsiveness in ordering a keyboard without asking. This somewhat lowers the rating in conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.5
The individual falls in the middle of the scale for extraversion. They show a mix of sociability and reservedness. While they are friendly with coworkers and like to socialize, they can also be reserved in unfamiliar social situations, as seen when they are reluctant to attend social events if their best friend isn't going. They also describe themselves as a listener rather than an active participant in group meetings or discussions. They care about others and willing to uplift their spirit, but the tendency to take a laid-back, observing role is indicative of an introverted nature. Therefore, there are instances of social curiosity, but also a tendency to withdraw or hold back.
