Conscientiousness: 3.8 
Extraversion: 2.5 

Explanation: 

In terms of conscientiousness, the respondent has shown efforts to focus on the importance of the task, like reading work orders multiple times, and not acting on their impulses in order to get a good deal. Their desire to improve on their organization skills and acknowledge when they are not operating at their best also suggests that they give importance to conscientious ways of behaving. They also show a drive for pushing themselves even when the tasks are challenging, such as physical exercises or work situations that require effort. Thus, a rating of 3.8 is suitable as it indicates a reasonably high level of conscientiousness. 

However, when it comes to extraversion, the respondent tends to take the role of a listener in group discussions and prefers to miss out on after-work social events due to restraints in social interaction. Even though they try to cheer people up from time to time, they rate themselves as more introverted, showing an understandable degree of nervousness and wariness of what others think of them. Their narrative shows a balance of instances where they try to partake in social interactions but also a significant amount where they refrain from it. So a rating of 2.5 would represent an average level of extraversion, indicating a balance between introversion and extraversion within this individual.
