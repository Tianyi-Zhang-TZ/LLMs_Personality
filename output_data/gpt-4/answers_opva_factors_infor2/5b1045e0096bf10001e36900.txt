Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 3.0

The respondent shows a good amount of Conscientiousness, demonstrated by their attention to detail at work, their commitment to their tasks even when they proved to be challenging, and their impulse control in a situation where they desired something badly but didn't act on this impulse. However, there are instances where the respondent shows a lack of organisation, such as when they didn't tidy up after using their work equipment, which prevents a higher score in this respect. 

In terms of Extraversion, the respondent is not extremely outgoing or preferring to centre themselves in social situations, as noted from their discomfort in situations where they didn't know anyone and from their group meeting experience where they were serving more as a conduit of information than a typical, assertive leader. Nevertheless, they do have moments of reaching out and socialising with others such as at their work social events and when encouraging their team. Therefore, their behavior is somewhere in-between an introverted and extroverted type, hence the middle-ground score.
