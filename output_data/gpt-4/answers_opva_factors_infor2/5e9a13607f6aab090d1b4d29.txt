Conscientiousness: 2.5
Extraversion: 3.0

The person's rating in Conscientiousness is average because their answers suggest that they complete tasks and pay attention to details, but also mention situations where they hesitate or avoid tasks. For instance, in Question 2, they mention putting everything back in place which shows a sense of organization but in the same breath also admit that they aren't a handyman. In Question 4 as well, they seem to pass off a challenge rather than handle it itself. 

The rating for Extraversion is slightly above average because of the individual's positive orientation towards social activities and settings. They have presented themselves as willing to engage in social events and are comfortable in groups. They take leadership roles and try to uplift team spirit which are typical extravert characteristics. However, some hesitations and discomfort in unknown social settings are also noted which prevent a higher score.
