Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The interviewee consistently demonstrated a high level of conscientiousness throughout their responses. They consistently showed they are dependable and have a strong sense of duty, displayed through their choosing to persevere with tasks even when they were difficult, continuously asking for help when they didn't know where certain things went, and avoiding impulse decisions even when they wanted something badly. They are also meticulously oriented to details and prefer to do things in order and maintain an organized environment.

Extraversion: 3.0 
The level of extraversion is moderate. The person can be socially engaged and inclined to raise spirits when familiar people are around. They also manage to strike conversations with strangers when it's necessary. However, they also consistently describe themselves as reserved and shy. Particularly in unfamiliar settings, this person assumes a more passive role. This indicates that there are some elements of introversion.
