Conscientiousness: 4.0 
The individual shows a fair amount of Conscientiousness throughout their responses - they indicate that they like to leave items better than they find them, they push themselves to overcome tasks even if they're challenging, they pay great attention to detail with triple-checking their work, and they will act quickly to achieve a goal. However, in Question 4 and 8, they also mentioned needing assistance from others to complete a task, which may indicate a slight lack of complete self-efficacy and diligence, a key trait of high Conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 4.5 
The individual shows high Extraversion in their responses. They seem comfortable in social settings, even when they're out of their comfort zone. They typically take the lead in group situations, and they make a point to attend social events and build bonds with their co-workers. They also show care for their team members' wellbeing, indicating that they are sensitive to others' feelings, an aspect of assertiveness in the Extraversion dimension. The slight gap from a full 5.0 is due to the fact that the individual also shows signs of acceptable introversion, like feeling slightly intimidated when in a completely unfamiliar social setting.
