Conscientiousness: 3.5 
The interviewee displayed moderate-to-high levels of conscientiousness. They mentioned being detail-oriented, direct, and diligently pushing themselves to complete challenging tasks instead of passing it on to others. However, they also admitted to occasionally being lazy and not always tidying up after using equipment at work, which dampens their score in this category.

Extraversion: 2.0 
The interviewee continually described themselves as more introverted. They exhibited less of a drive to seek out social interactions, such as choosing to skip social events after work and being slow to engage with people they do not know well. However, they did show empathy when their team was feeling down and tried to lift their spirits, which speaks to some level of sociability.
