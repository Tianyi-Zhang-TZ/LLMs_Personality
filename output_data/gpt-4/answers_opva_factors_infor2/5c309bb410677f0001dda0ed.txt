Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 4.3

The person seems to demonstrate a high level of conscientiousness, as indicated by their attention to detail, tendency to thoroughly complete tasks and adherence to procedure (Questions 2, 4, 6, 8). They show a deep commitment to their work obligations and take pride in their ability to solve challenging tasks. They also exhibit a reluctance to act impulsively in a critical situation, suggesting they are thoughtful and well-organized.

The person also displays strong extraversion traits, but not in an overbearing manner. They are comfortable asserting themselves in social situations when necessary, but also value the opinions of others and are willing to step back and allow others to lead, suggesting an adaptive level of extraversion (Questions 1, 3, 5, 7). Even the reluctance to attend after-work social events is not due to discomfort with social interaction, but from the dislike of the setting, hence the slight reduction from a perfect score. They demonstrate leadership abilities by noticing and attending to the morale of their team, which is another common quality of an extraverted individual.
