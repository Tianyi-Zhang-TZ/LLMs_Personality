Conscientiousness: 3.8
Extraversion: 2.8

The individual showed conscientious behaviors overall by presenting a consistent concern for details (cleaning routines, coding lessons, carefulness in personal fitness routines, and fixing a piece of furniture), showing a desire for organization, and demonstrating effort in work tasks. The person seems to make decisions considering their potential impact and shows responsibility (like the situation with the stool at work). However, even though the person is aware of the importance of task completion and details, they did acknowledge certain situations where the willpower wavered, especially when a task was complex or challenging, indicating that they're largely conscientious but might struggle when an extra effort is required.

In terms of Extraversion, the person is more inclined towards introversion but is not entirely introverted. They actively avoided new social interactions and preferred staying in their comfort zones, especially in new or uncertain gatherings. This is evident from their experience at the friend's open house and their decision to skip the co-worker's social event in favor of relaxation at home. On the other hand, they also showed some extraverted tendencies, such as taking a leadership role during a board game, helping to raise the spirit of their teammates during a basketball game, and being able to socially interact when necessary. This juxtaposition suggests they are not strongly introverted, rather, somewhere in-between - indicating a lower score in terms of pure Extraversion.
