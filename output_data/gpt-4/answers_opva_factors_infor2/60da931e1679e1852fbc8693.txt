Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.0

The individual shows a high level of Conscientiousness, as evidenced by their attention to organization, responsibility, and detail (question 2 and 6), their ability to prioritize tasks (question 4), and their cautious approach to desires and impulses in the workplace (question 8). Their rating in Conscientiousness is slightly reduced due to their mention of abandoning tasks if they lack interest (question 4), which shows a potential gap in self-discipline, a key aspect of Conscientiousness.

In terms of Extraversion, the person portrays more introverted behaviors. They express discomfort in unfamiliar social situations (question 1) and an inclination toward independent or quiet activities in their downtime (question 5). Even though they can step into leadership roles and help boost team spirits (question 3 and 7), they clarified that this occurs primarily in familiar settings among known individuals, indicating a selective sociability. Despite these valuable social interactions, their stated overall preference for solitude and quiet contribute to a lower Extraversion score.
