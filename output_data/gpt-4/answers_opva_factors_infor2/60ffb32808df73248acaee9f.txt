Conscientiousness: 4.5
The interviewee consistently demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness throughout her responses.

She aims for perfection and is highly responsible, seeking structure and demonstrating a clear commitment to her duties.

Extraversion: 3.0
The responses indicate a medium level of extraversion. In group settings, she is comfortable leading when she feels confident about the subject, but also doesn't mind assuming a listening role in other circumstances. She is able to interact positively with unfamiliar people, such as her boyfriend's family and friends, yet also admits feelings of discomfort in such situations.
