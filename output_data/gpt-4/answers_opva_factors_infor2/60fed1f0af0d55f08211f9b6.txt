Conscientiousness: 4.0 
In all the situations that the individual was involved, they tend to be methodical and well planned. They prefer to think things through, understand the situation and act judiciously rather than acting impulsively. They also demonstrate personal responsibility to complete tasks and pay attention to details, not leaving tasks half done. The only factor hindering a perfect score is their own mentioned struggle with an attention disorder, which at times challenges their concentration.

Extraversion: 3.5 
Overall, this person leans towards being extroverted. There seems to be a strong inclination towards understanding and empathizing with others, helping to lift their spirits, and facilitating greater group dynamics. However, they also demonstrate an initial shyness and discomfort in social situations, often observing and analyzing the environment and people's emotions before becoming more active and outgoing. They also prefer planned social activities, rather than spur-of-the-moment events. These characteristics together put them slightly above average on the extraversion scale.
