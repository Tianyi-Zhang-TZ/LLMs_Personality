Conscientiousness: 4.8 
The individual shows a high level of conscientiousness as they consistently highlight their organized nature, strategic mind, attention to detail, and dislike for making mistakes. They also take pride in their work and are driven by quality. Furthermore, their approach to challenging situations is to push harder and ensure that the task is completed – they don’t quit or pass the task to someone else. This person also isn't afraid to assert themselves when they believe action needs to be taken for a significant potential benefit.

Extraversion: 4.2 
While the individual initially presents as shy or uncomfortable in new social situations, they quickly adapt and engage with others actively. They show a willingness to join social events, assumed a leading role in a group discussion, and actively worked to raise team members' spirit during low times. This behavior suggests they are somewhat extraverted; they display adaptability and gradually become more comfortable and active in social settings instead of remaining reserved or aloof. While they are socially active, the initial discomfort in social situations slightly lowers this score.
