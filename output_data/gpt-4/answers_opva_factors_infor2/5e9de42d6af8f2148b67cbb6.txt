Moreover, in question 4, the determination and resilience shown while struggling with a wrenching Calculus assignment also displays a high level of Conscientiousness.

They also enjoy social events and try to make others laugh in question 7 to boost their spirits, which shows sociability, a hallmark of Extroversion.

Hence, the slightly lower score on Extraversion compared to Conscientiousness.
