Based on the answers provided, the ratings are as follows:

Conscientiousness: 4.6 
The subject displayed high degree of conscientiousness on numerous occasions. They demonstrated an understanding of their responsibilities in group and work settings, delegating tasks when necessary but also taking the initiative to ensure tasks were completed to a high standard. Moreover, they illustrated traits associated with conscientiousness such as attention to detail, dedication to complete challenging tasks, and acting responsibly with their colleagues' equipment. Their level of self-discipline, thoroughness, and planning showed a high degree of conscientiousness. Nevertheless, they sometimes delegated responsibilities to others rather than addressing them personally, hence the score isn't a perfect 5. 

Extraversion: 3.1 
The subject displayed balanced traits of an introvert and extravert personality. They expressed feelings of discomfort in social situations where they didn't know people but also showed the ability to adapt and become more at ease as the setting progressed. They took on leadership roles in group discussions and believed in motivating their team, pointing to strong aspects of extraversion. However, their preference to maintain a professional distance from colleagues after work events and slight discomfort in social situations pulled their score down slightly. Their extraversion manifested more prominently in professional scenarios rather than casual social settings, thus resulting in a moderate rating.
