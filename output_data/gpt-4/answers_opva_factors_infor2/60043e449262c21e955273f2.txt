Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.5

Why:
The answers given provide a bit of complexity. Despite some language errors, the responses hint at some level of cautiousness and organization indicative of conscientiousness. Concretely, in Question 2, the person tends to plan and likes to establish goals in using work equipment. In Question 4, they push themselves to take on challenges, which shows motivation and diligence. Similarly, in Question 6, there's an implication of careful attention to avoiding mistakes.

However, their conscientiousness does not seem to be extremely high as there's some ambiguity in the language they use, which could suggest lack of clarity in their goals or tasks. Therefore, they're rated at a moderate level of 3.5. 

In terms of extraversion, the person seems more introverted based on the given answers. Most notably, in Question 1, the individual indicates a discomfort in social situations where they do not know anyone else. Although they participate in group discussions and appear considerate of their team (Questions 3 and 7), the given answers do not clearly represent an enthusiastic or outgoing personality. 

However, they have shown some willingness to step up and share their experiences (Question 3) which is why they are not given the lowest score in extraversion. Instead, they receive a slightly below average score of 2.5. The person's wording does lack the clarity and decisiveness commonly seen in more extraverted individuals which impacts their score.
