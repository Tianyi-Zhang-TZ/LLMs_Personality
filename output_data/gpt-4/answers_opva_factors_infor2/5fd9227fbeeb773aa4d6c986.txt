Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The person frequently demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness. They've repeatedly mentioned being meticulous, organized, and a hard worker. They strive to make things better for everyone at their workplace and consider other's needs above their own, which further highlights their sense of responsibility. They also considered moral choices when they wanted something, showing they stick to their principles and possess impulse control. However, they admit to not being naturally neat and needing to remind themselves to be selfless, which prevents a full score.

Extraversion: 2.0 
The person appears to be more introverted. They usually choose to listen rather than lead during group discussions and often feel nervous in unfamiliar social situations. They've mentioned being reserved and solitary, preferring focusing on alone time. Also, they chose to skip a social event, further indicating their preference for solitude over socializing. However, their active effort to raise team members' spirits when they're feeling down shows their potential for social interaction when they feel it's needed or essential. This offers some balance, preventing the score from being extremely low.
