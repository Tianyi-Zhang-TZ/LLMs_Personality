Conscientiousness: 4.8
The individual describes themselves as meticulous, passionate, detail-oriented, and generally a hard-worker. This is shown in their desire to complete their work thoroughly (in reference to the rock wall interim job and university equipment project) and create a safe and orderly environment (shown in the work equipment organization example and the university rock climbing gear situation). They are seen taking initiative, showing responsibility and anticipating tasks. They handle pressure and seem to care about the impact of their actions on their team members.

Extraversion: 3.5
While this individual appears to lean towards introversion with their expressed preference for small group settings and the discomfort in speaking in front of large crowds of unknown people, they also demonstrate extraverted qualities. They have held leadership positions, speak openly and comfortably about engaging with their team, and have even put effort into social interactions in a work setting. Their preference for smaller groups and one-on-one interactions, and described discomfort in large social situations, somewhat limits their score for extraversion.
