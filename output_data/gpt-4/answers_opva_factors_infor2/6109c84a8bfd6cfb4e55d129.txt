Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The subject has shown a high degree of Conscientiousness in their responses. They frequently mention asking for help, taking responsibility, and admitting to not knowing everything, showing carefulness, and thoughtful patience in their approach to work problems. They also discuss the importance of planning and thoughtful decision-making in response to Question 8, which shows their ability to avoid impulsivity. However, some inconsistencies such as not always maintaining order at work can take away some points, hence 4.5 instead of a full 5.

Extraversion: 4.7
The subject also presents a high degree of Extraversion. They are very comfortable in social situations, even when they don't know anyone (Question 1), and aren't afraid to take leadership roles in discussions (Question 3). Furthermore, their willingness to join social events (Question 5) and lift team members' spirits (Question 7) also speaks to their extraversion. However, their indication of feeling comfortable in not attending every social event and not always feeling responsible to lift the teamâ€™s spirit may mean that they are slightly less than extraordinarily outgoing or assertive. Thus, they earn a high score, but still less than a perfect 5.
