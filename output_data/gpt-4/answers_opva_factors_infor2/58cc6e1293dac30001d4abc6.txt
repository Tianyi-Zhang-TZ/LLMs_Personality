Conscientiousness: 3.8 
Extraversion: 2.8 

The subject's conscientiousness appears to be fairly high based on their responses, although they sometimes exhibit a lack of clear focus and organization when describing their actions and intentions. This indicates that while they do strive to act with a sense of responsibility and effort, they may struggle with some elements of self-discipline or organization. 

In terms of extraversion, the subject seems to be somewhere in the middle. They regularly put themselves in social situations and attempt to engage with others. However, they also mention feelings of discomfort and seem to prefer familiar or controlled settings. It suggests a blend of introverted and extroverted traits. They are willing to engage with others and can enjoy social interaction, but may not actively seek out and thrive in large or unfamiliar social gatherings as much as someone with high extraversion.
