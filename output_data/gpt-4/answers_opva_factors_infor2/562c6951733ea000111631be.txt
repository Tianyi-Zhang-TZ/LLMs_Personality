Conscientiousness: 4.7 
Extraversion: 3.2 

The individual scored high on conscientiousness as he showed an outstanding level of organization, being thorough, mindful of details, holding high workplace standards and prefers to keep everything in order, not hesitating in assigning tasks to others when necessary. This is evident in his bartending profession where he maintains order and cleanliness, especially when handling important equipment. He also displayed the ability to stay composed and vigilant in challenging situations, indicating resilience, a trait of high conscientiousness. 

On the other hand, the individual's extraversion score is at a moderate level. He displayed comfort in asserting opinions and handling leadership roles in the workplace, showing a good level of assertiveness. However, he prefers to keep his personal and professional lives separate, often declining social events with coworkers. His level of extraversion seems to differ between his workplace manner (more extraverted) and his personal life approach (more introverted), leading to a medium overall score. While he does engage with his team members at work to maintain morale, it might be more driven by the need for a productive workplace rather than purely social engagements.
