Conscientiousness: 4.5
The individual constantly showcases a strong work ethic and a high level of responsibility in their work. Their stories reflect commitment to their duties, tidiness, organization, and attention to detail. Moreover, they exhibit a high level of professional integrity: they took care to model proper conduct in the corporate restaurant (question 2) and took on the challenge of a kitchen with staff absences (question 4). Their decision to patiently build up their reputation in the hotel (question 8) also shows a strong sense of patience and diligence. They lost a half point as they admit to being not fully coordinated in certain tasks, as shown in their example about serving champagne (question 6), but this is a minor point compared to their overall conscientious behavior.

Extraversion: 4.0
The individual typically demonstrates a tendency toward sociability, assertiveness, and talkativeness. They express comfort in social situations where they do not know anyone (question 1). They are also quite capable and happy to take a leadership role when needed (question 3 and 7). Still, their answers hint at a slight restraint towards overly engaging with younger colleagues in social settings (question 5) and in the group discussion (question 3). But they clearly enjoy and are skilled at interacting with people in their work settings.
