Conscientiousness: 3.5 
Extraversion: 2.5 

Reasoning: The individual demonstrates a fairly good level of Conscientiousness (3.5) through their responses. They often mention putting forth maximum effort regardless of the difficulties or challenges present. For example, even when a task at work felt tedious or when tasks required attention to detail despite it being stressful, they pushed themselves to get it done which shows their sense of duty and level of self-discipline. 

When it comes to extraversion, however, the individual leans towards being more introverted (2.5), as they often prefer to stay at home rather than attending social events and they don't particularly enjoy being in crowds. However, they also demonstrated aspects of extraversion such as stepping up in a leadership role in group projects and trying their best to raise the spirits of their team members when they were feeling down. This shows a capacity for assertiveness and warmth when the situation calls for it, despite their general introverted nature. Therefore, they display a moderate level of extraversion, but slightly more towards the lower end.
