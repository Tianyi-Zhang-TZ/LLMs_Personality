Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The person demonstrates an ability to carry out tasks diligently and refers to a number of situations where she pays close attention to detail. For instance, when receiving or inspecting equipment at work, or when dealing with customer credit limits. She also shows the capability to resist acting impulsively, especially regarding customer management in her collections role. However, room for improvement may come from successfully dealing with challenges and not just doing the best she can.

Extraversion: 3.0 
The person does seem to interact well within group discussions, team roles, dealing with customers in her work, and family meetings. However, she also mentions her shyness and reluctance when first dealing with new situations or unfamiliar people. This introverted tendency is clearly shown in her hesitation to attend a coworkerâ€™s baby shower. But her proven capability to overcome this shyness and engage in socialization events gives her an averaged score on this trait.
