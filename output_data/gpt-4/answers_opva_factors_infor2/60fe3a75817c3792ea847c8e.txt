Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.5 

The rating for conscientiousness is quite high because in every situation where the person was required to show discipline, they consistently showed it, portraying organization, dutifulness, carefulness and discipline in the situations questioned. The person often mentions listening, respect, doing their best, trying to have a clean workplace, and attempting to do something within their limits before asking for help, which all align well with the HEXCO model's conception of conscientiousness.

As for extraversion, the person scored in the median range. While they often mention being reserved and not so comfortable in the most social environments, and enjoying time alone or at home, they also display behaviors that show some level of comfort in conversing with others and trying to engage with them. Moreover, they also display leadership qualities, the ability to maintain a conversation, and enthusiasm when they see their team members needing a boost of morale. However, they seem to have a stronger inclination for introverted behaviors, which results in a score leaning towards the lower side.
