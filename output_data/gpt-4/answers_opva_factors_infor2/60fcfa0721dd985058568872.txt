Conscientiousness: 4.8 
This individual demonstrates a high level of Conscientiousness, as reflected in their attention to detail, ambition to resolve tasks, willingness to fix or clean tasks left incomplete or messy by others, and their careful consideration of actions rather than acting on impulse. The individual shows strong evidence of reliability, organization, discipline, and carefulness, which are key characteristics of conscientiousness. The reason that an absolute score of 5 isn't given is because they also express a desire to not let heavy work fall on others, which could sometimes lead to taking on too much and potentially risking burnout or reduced quality of work.

Extraversion: 3.5
The personâ€™s level of extraversion is average. While the individual describes themselves as being outgoing and enjoys socializing with known people, they also confess to being shy around strangers until they get to know them better. They also prefer to occupy the role of a listener rather than being the center of attention or the lead speaker, even in social situations. This shows that they can perform well socially but might not always push for social interaction, especially in unknown environments or groups, which are tendencies of an introvert as well as an extrovert. They get a middle score as they seem to posses an equilibrium of both introvert and extrovert traits.
