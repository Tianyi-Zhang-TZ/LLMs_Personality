Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness by cleanly organizing their space, staying focused on tasks that require attention to detail, pushing themselves to work hard, and their desire to leave things in a good state for others. The individual also places great importance on completing tasks, so much so that they feel like a failure when they are unable to do so. These are all indicative of a highly conscientious personality. However, the limited flexibility in task management and the slight over-controlling nature displayed in some responses prevent a full score.

Extraversion: 1.5 
The individual tends to be socially avoidant, showing signs of significant introversion. They express discomfort and lack of confidence in social situations, particularly with new people or large groups. Even though they try to listen actively and lead in group settings, they report a sense of anxiety and difficulty maintaining attention. This suggest they are low in extraversion. However, they do demonstrate some willingness to take on leading roles and made an effort in interacting with others even if it makes them uncomfortable, which prevents a minimum score.
