Conscientiousness: 4.8
The individual consistently demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness in their responses. They take their tasks seriously, pay attention to detail especially in their pharmacy work, and demonstrate an understanding of the implications of their actions. Their consistent practice of returning things to their correct places also shows that they prefer an organized environment. However, there is an instance where they passed a problem to someone else suggesting that they might not be perfect in handling all types of challenging situations.

The individual shows strong signs of extraversion. They're comfortable in social situations and take the initiative to engage and befriend strangers, they employ humor to uplift the mood of their team, and generally assume the role of a talker in discussions.

However, there might be instances where they are not completely comfortable in managing certain levels of social pressure, hence not a perfect 5.0.
