Conscientiousness: 4.8
The respondent indicates a high level of Conscientiousness, evident through multiple statements in their answers demonstrating attention to detail, high degree of responsibility, organization, and a conscious avoidance of impulsive acts. Their inclination towards cleanliness and preference for things being in their proper places show carefulness and meticulous behaviors, which are hallmarks of high conscientiousness. They also showed a high degree of discipline and motivation in handling challenging tasks.

Extraversion: 2.1
Extraversion is rated lower in this case as the respondent describes herself as an introvert and often shows signs of reluctance or discomfort in social situations. She appears to struggle with initiating interactions in new social settings and prefers others to initiate conversations. However, her willingness to take leadership roles and efforts to boost team morale during necessary times shows that she is capable of demonstrating extraversion to a certain extent when required or when she feels comfortable in the environment. Even though she does step into such roles, her tendency to revert to introvert settings indicates an overall lower level of Extraversion.
