Conscientiousness: 4.2 
The interviewee frequently demonstrates a desire for methodical, well-organised ways of doing things, showing a high level of conscientiousness. Examples of this include the way they put their work equipment back, paying attention to details, pushing themselves when tasks are challenging and the way they navigate wanting something badly at work. However, they have also mentioned instances of requiring assistance which shows they might sometimes feel overwhelmed that affects the rating slightly. 

Extraversion: 4.0
The interviewee describes themselves as generally comfortable and approachable in unfamiliar social situations, but they donâ€™t seek to be the center of attention. They have good listening skills but also want to be heard and understood in group discussions, showing balanced extraversion qualities. Their tendency to raise spirits when their teammates are down also indicates their extraverted nature. The rating is not the maximum because they still show some signs of unease or discomfort in certain social situations.
