Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 4.0

The extraversive personality trait of the person is fairly high based on the person’s ability to eventually ease into social situations by taking leading roles and making efforts to maintain and build relationships (as manifested by the person’s involvement in the pool party event). However, there is also a noticeable level of introversion predicated upon self-reported discomfort when initially faced with unfamiliar professionals, possibly suggesting that the person may lean towards being an ambivert. On the other hand, the level of conscientiousness is significantly high. The person showcased noticeable attention to detail, a tendency to abide by rules and guidelines, and displayed a strong will to persist through challenging tasks. Moreover, the person can be quite methodical and organized as indicated by the habit of keeping things neat and in order.
