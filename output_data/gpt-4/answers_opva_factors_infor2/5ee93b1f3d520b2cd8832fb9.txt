Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual demonstrates high levels of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, organization, and desire to finish and take responsibility for tasks. They also show strong self-discipline and a thoughtful approach to decision-making instead of acting impulsively, which are key features of high conscientiousness. However, as they occasionally rely on others' help when tasks become too challenging, the rating is not a perfect 5. 

Extraversion: 3.5 
The person displays a balanced mix of extraversion and introversion. They describe themselves as a quiet person who tends to listen more than talk in group discussions and sometimes considers skipping social events to relax at home. However, they also make efforts to connect with others, take leadership roles in their fraternity, and actively try to raise team members' spirits when they're feeling down. They don't shy away from social situations but rather see them as opportunities to meet new people, come out of their shell, and form connections. While their extraversion is not overly dominant, they clearly possess a moderate degree of this characteristic.
