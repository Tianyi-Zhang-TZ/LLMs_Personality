Conscientiousness: 4.3
Extraversion: 3.8

The person exhibits a high tendency towards conscientiousness, seen throughout the questions where he/she demonstrated organized behavior, dedication towards responsibilities and the commitment to detail. The person takes initiative and does not shy away from hard work or challenging situations, shown in the marketing project scenario where he/she had to take on most of the work. However, the person is not impulsive and rationalizes actions, particularly when the stakes are high which refers to the last question reducing the maximum score for this trait. 

The individual seems to be reasonably extroverted as well but not extremely so. The person shows instances of both shyness in unfamiliar social situations, and an active effort to be outgoing and open in order to ensure social cohesion and comfort. Hence the individual is not necessarily naturally extroverted, but can adapt depending on the situation. This active effort to engage with people and make them feel comfortable does, however, provide a strong indication of a level of extraversion, although not fully natural or effortless.
