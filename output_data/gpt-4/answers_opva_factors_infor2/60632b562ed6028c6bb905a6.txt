Conscientiousness: 4.6
The participant mentioned several times that they are focused and detail-oriented especially when it comes to tasks and work. They did describe themselves as feeling very intense and stressed out in situations where things weren't going according to plan like the copier machine breaking down or when they accidentally accepted a complex assignment. But they also mentioned being very stubborn and focused in finishing a task once they have committed to it, even if it was accidental like the complex assignment. This shows they are determined, responsible, and goal-directed â€“ traits of someone with high rating in conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.4
The participant seemed to have a balanced approach in dealing with social situations - while they put on a happy front at the funeral despite feeling uncomfortable, they also admitted to being comfortable playing the listener role during group discussions, in attending after-work social events despite being a natural homebody or when handling emotional crisis of team members at work. This shows they can display openness and talkative traits typical of an extrovert when required, but might prefer quieter, less socially intense environments. As such, their extraversion score is a mild-to-moderate one.
