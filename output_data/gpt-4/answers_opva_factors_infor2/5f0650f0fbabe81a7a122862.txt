The respondent also mentioned that he is not impulsive at work and often calculates risks, which suggests high conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.0 
The respondent exhibits moderate levels of extraversion. While he did mention about feeling uncomfortable in a large group setting where he didn't know anyone, he approached the situation as a potential networking opportunity.
