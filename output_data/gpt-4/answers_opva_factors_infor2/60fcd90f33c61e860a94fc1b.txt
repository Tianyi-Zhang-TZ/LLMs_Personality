The person described consistently shows a high level of organization, attention to detail, and responsibility. From finding their place in a new job, pushing through a challenging academic problem, to constructing furniture sets, the person shows they are motivated to do their tasks right and to the best of their abilities. This indicates their high conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.7 
The person seems to be generally comfortable in social situations and willing to take on leadership roles. For example, leading discussions in Socratic seminars and encouraging team spirit in soccer games.
