Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

Explanation:

This individual shows high levels of conscientiousness, often considering the details, implications and responsibility associated with the tasks they undertake. They have a strong work ethic, they often speak about planning, completing and being responsible for their work, taking the initiative where possible. They express a clear desire to meet expectations and fulfill their obligations, which strongly fits into the criteria for a higher score on the Conscientiousness scale.

On the other hand, though this person can clearly function in social situations and is able to communicate effectively, there are also strong signs of introversion. They often describe feeling uncomfortable or anxious in social settings, particularly when they don't know anyone, and seem to favor listening over leading during group discussions, although they can do both. They demonstrate empathy and compassion but also some hesitancy or discomfort in social interactions and express that they value their own input in group discussion after carefully hearing others. All these cues indicate a moderate degree on the Extraversion scale.
