Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 4.3

Conscientiousness is rated highly due to the repeated references of careful planning, attention to detail, thought before action and commitment to team goals and organization. The respondent consistently shows a disciplined nature, strong sense of duty, and is also methodical in their approach towards work, which all align with the qualities of conscientiousness.

Extraversion is also scored high as the individual has shown comfort in social situations and expressed desire to engage with others, be it in a group discussion or a social event. They self-described as "outgoing", "sociable", "talkative" and "upbeat". Even while expressing some amount of reservation in new social settings, the individual's effort to "establish connection" and use of a "playful" demeanor to cheer up a team indicates a high level of extraversion. However, the slight reservation in new environments prevents a full score.
