Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual shows a significant level of conscientiousness in his responses. He discusses taking on additional workload, maintaining organization and professionalism at work, and pushing through challenging tasks with passion and discipline. He also takes care to pay attention to small details, as illustrated by his response to question six. Furthermore, this person demonstrates an understanding of responsibilities at work and thoughtful planning, seen in his decision-making process concerning gas and mileage for deliveries. His way of responding suggests he values reliability and takes a careful, thought-out approach to his tasks and responsibilities.

Extraversion: 3.0
The individual's responses present him as somewhat introverted rather than an extreme extrovert. He discusses being reluctant and anxious about attending social events and prefers smaller groups or being alone, signifying a lower level of extraversion. His response to question one does not provide vivid information about social interaction, which makes it a bit tricky to judge his extraversion level. However, he does display some extraverted tendencies by stepping into leadership roles in a group setting and trying to boost the morale of his team in difficult times. This combination suggests he may lean toward being an introvert or may be an ambivert, someone who falls in the middle of the extraversion scale.
