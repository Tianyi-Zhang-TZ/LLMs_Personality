Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The person demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness (4.5 out of 5) as they often emphasis on being organized, detail-oriented, and following rules. They seem to take pride in their work quality and tend to push themselves to finish tasks even when they are challenging. They show to be self-sufficient and considerate about their surroundings (e.g., putting things back after usage at work, not acting on impulses at work), all of which are indicative of the conscientiousness trait.

Conversely, the person shows a moderate level of extraversion (2.5 out of 5), expressing that they are generally reserved and quiet, preferring to keep to themselves. While they are trying to overcome their discomfort in social situations and make an effort to interact with others, they also mention having difficulties being social for prolonged periods. They also state that they are often hesitant to be the leader in group discussions and prefer listening instead. The responses indicate they have some extraverted behaviors, but they lean more towards introversion. Therefore, a moderate rating is given because their tendency to engage in social situations is not completely absent but rather on a borderline level.
