Conscientiousness: 4.4 
The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness across their responses. They exhibit a distinct sense of responsibility, even feeling guilty when they can't tidy up after using equipment at work (Question 2), and they tend to push themselves to take up challenging tasks (Question 4). The individual expresses a strong attention to detail (Question 6) and a tendency to resist acting on impulse, instead favoring careful, reasoned decision-making (Question 8). However, they mention sometimes overlooking details in a rush to finish tasks, slightly reducing the overall score.

Extraversion: 4.2
The individual appears fairly extroverted. Their discomfort in situations where they don't know people seems to stem more from concerns about how they are perceived rather than a dislike of social situations itself (Question 1). They are open to striking up conversations and enjoy making others laugh (Question 1, Question 7). They often take up leading roles in group discussions (Question 3) and are typically inclined to join after-work social events (Question 5). A slight reduction in the score is due to the fact that they occasionally skip social activities because they feel drained (Question 5).
