Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The interviewee showcases a high degree of conscientiousness in various situations, demonstrating consistent attention to detail, perseverance even when tasks are difficult, willingness to take responsibility, and ethical behavior. They evidently value hard work and methodically approach tasks. Prospective improvements could relate to guiding actions with better-considered constructs or guidelines, apart from simply trying their best and being detail-oriented.

Extraversion: 4.8 
The interviewee displays high extraversion by demonstrating they frequently take leadership roles, have a positive outlook, are keen to meet new people and are very comfortable being social. They describe themselves as social numerous times and often recounts enjoying and seeking out social interactions and opportunities. The slightly less than perfect score only reflects a small reserve initially displayed in unknown social situations as mentioned in the college example. However, they seem to overcome this fairly quickly as indicated by their proactive approach in similar circumstances.
