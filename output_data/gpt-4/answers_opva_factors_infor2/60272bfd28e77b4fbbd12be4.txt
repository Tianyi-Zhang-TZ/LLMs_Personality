Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

Reasons: The respondent displays high levels of conscientiousness throughout their responses. They express a strong attention to detail, they aim to keep their area orderly and to put things back where they belong, they engage and push through challenging tasks, and they show thoughtfulness in their actions rather than acting impulsively, all of which align with the characteristics of high conscientiousness.

In terms of Extraversion, their rating is average to low. The respondent shows signs of introversion in their responses. They mention often feeling nervous and uncomfortable in social situations and preferring to keep to themselves. However, they also show adaptability and some comfort in talking to others once they get accustomed to their surroundings and can become more proactive and open to conversation. Hence, they aren't placed at the lowest end of the Extraversion scale, warranting a 2.5 rating.
