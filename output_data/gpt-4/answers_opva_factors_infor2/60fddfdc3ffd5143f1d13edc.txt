Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.0 

The person seems to be highly conscientious, displaying a strong sense of duty, being organized, methodical, and respectful of rules. This is evidenced by their responses where they consider the workplace environment (Question 2), their personal motivation and responsibility in handling tasks (Question 4), their meticulous attention to detail (Question 6), and their ambitious drive to achieve more at work (Question 8). 

Contrarily, this person scores lower on the Extraversion scale. They describe themselves as being introverted, more reserved in social settings where they don't know the people (Question 1), more comfortable in the listener role during group discussions (Question 3), and hesitant to participate in social events (Question 5). However, they show some level of extraversion in their inclination to improve the moods of their colleagues (Question 7), but these extravert tendencies seem situation-dependent. So, overall extraversion score would remain low for this person.
