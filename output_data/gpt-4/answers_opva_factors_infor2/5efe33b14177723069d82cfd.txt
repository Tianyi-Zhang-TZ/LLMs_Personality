Conscientiousness: 4.0 
The respondent consistently demonstrated conscientious behavior across the series of situations. For example, in the question about using equipment at work (Question 2), the participant demonstrated a keen sense of responsibility by not only learning how to use the machine but also ensuring everything was returned to its rightful place. In another instance (Question 4), when faced with a challenging task the participant decided to take responsibility and work harder rather than passing the workload onto someone else. Therefore, this reveals a higher level of Conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.8 
The respondent exhibited a good level of Extraversion, particularly apparent in Question 1 where they made the effort to socialize at an event where they didn't know anyone. In Question 3, the individual took a more listening role but this could be attributed to the specific situation than a lack of extraversion. In Question 5, the respondent chose to attend an after-work social event and enjoyed participating, demonstrating extraversion. However, the level seems slightly lower than Conscientiousness, as she also mentioned feelings of shyness and discomfort in social situations, and taking a more listening role in group discussions, which could indicate a more introverted side.
