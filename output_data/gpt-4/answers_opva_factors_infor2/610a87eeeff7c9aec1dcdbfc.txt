Based on the answers provided, I would provide the following ratings:

Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 3.7

Here's why:

From the answers given for the Conscientiousness factor, the person displays some traits consistent with high conscientiousness such as paying attention to detail, wanting to put things back in their place, and pushing harder when confronted with a challenging task. However, the person's comfort or discomfort in these situations also suggests certain limitations or ambivalence in their conscientious approach which leads to a rating of 3.5 in this factor.

From the answers given for the Extraversion factor, the person seems to be rather social and comfortable in group situations or in taking a lead to support others. They seem to enjoy the company of others and show willingness to assert themselves and encourage people around them. However, their preference towards listening in group discussions and feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social surroundings places a check on being rated at the higher end of the Extraversion spectrum, hence the rating of 3.7.
