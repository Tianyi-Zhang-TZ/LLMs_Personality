Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 2.0 

The person demonstrated a high degree of conscientiousness, as evident from the strictness, focus, and discipline associated with decision-making observed in their answers to concerns about work (Questions 2, 4, 6, and 8). They provided instances indicating a commitment to following rules, an inclination towards carefulness, and a will to manage tasks independently - all indicative of strong conscientiousness.

On the other hand, their degree of extraversion appears lower. The individual identified themselves as being shy, introverted, anxious, and self-conscious in unfamiliar or pressured contexts (Questions 1, 3, 5 and 7). Although there are moments where they attempt to be more assertive or open, these seem more situational or effortful, and their innate preference seems to lie towards introversion. Therefore, the lower rating for extraversion.
