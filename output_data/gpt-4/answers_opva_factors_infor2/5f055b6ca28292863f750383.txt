Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.5 

The person demonstrates a high level of Conscientiousness through their answers, expressing a strong attention to detail, a willingness to push through challenges independently, and to consider the needs of others in shared workspaces. This is reflected in both their anecdotal evidence and their general approach to tasks and responsibilities, making a high rating for Conscientiousness quite fitting.

Extraversion, on the other hand, is lower. Although the individual shows an ability to push past their comfort zone, their social anxiousness and preference for listening rather than leading in group discussions indicates a more introverted personality. Despite their attempts to be more outgoing, including their willingness to support their collegues' mood and join smaller gatherings, their comfort zone and instinctive reaction still leans towards introversion, thus a lower score on Extraversion is suggested.
