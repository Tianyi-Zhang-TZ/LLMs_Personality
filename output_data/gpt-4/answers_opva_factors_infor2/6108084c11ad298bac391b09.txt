Extraversion: 3.4

The person demonstrates high conscientiousness. The answers describe an individual who finishes tasks efficiently and diligently, meticulous in detail, takes on responsibility, and endeavors to exceed expectations. For instance, in Question 4, they chose an ambitious video project, going beyond what was required, demonstrating strong task commitment and perseverance, and in Question 8, their desire to prove themselves and earn the assistant manager spot shows high achievement-driven outlook. 

Their level of extraversion is found to be moderately high. They describe themselves as generally introverted, but they also enjoy social activities and getting to know others. They put on a fa√ßade of being extroverted, as exhibited in Question 1 when they were eager to befriend their roommates and in Question 5 when they pushed themselves to attend a social gathering even if they initially felt hesitant. Their ability and willingness to take leadership roles, as discussed in Question 3, also shows some degree of assertiveness, indicative of a moderate level of extraversion. However, their consistent mention of naturally being introverted brings down their rating slightly.
