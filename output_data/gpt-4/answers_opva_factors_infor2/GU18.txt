Conscientiousness: 4.8
Extraversion: 2.5

The person demonstrates a high degree of conscientiousness, as evident by his organized nature, attention to details, willingness to complete tasks without delegating to others, and how he mentioned wanting to do things in a manner beneficial to everyone on the team. These characteristics point toward a very disciplined, responsible, and thoughtful individual - traits associated with high conscientiousness. Hence, the rating of 4.8.

However, the person seems to display lower levels of extraversion. He talks about feeling potentially uncomfortable in social settings where he doesn't know anyone, portrays himself usually in a listening role during group discussions, and describes being selective about attending social gatherings after work (only if invited by close friends or if he doesn't have other commitments). These responses suggest that the person might not be very outgoing and sociable - traits related to extraversion - yet still adaptable depending on the environment, which is why a middle-of-the-road rating of 2.5 is assigned.
