Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.0

The conscientiousness rating of 3.5 indicates that the person exhibits a moderate-to-high degree of dependability, organization, self-discipline, and motivation. For example, this personâ€™s response to working on a challenging task represents a effortful engagement and care in completing it, which are hallmarks of conscientiousness (Question 4). Moreover, the individual often puts thought into avoiding potential mistakes, which suggests that they are detail-oriented and diligent, as seen in their tutoring experience (Question 6). However, the individual also expressed instances of neglecting work (Question 2) or being tempted to exaggerate credentials (Question 8), hence the rating is not at the highest level. 

The low extraversion rating of 2.0 is due to indications of being rather introverted and feeling uncomfortable in social situations, as well as avoiding confrontation. They often express discomfort in new social settings (Question 1 and Question 5), preferring to play on their phone over interacting with others. They also don't often take the lead in group projects unless it's a project they are passionate about (Question 3). Although they do show empathy towards their friends (Question 7), they expressed difficulty and avoidance behaviour in helping them, which contributes to their lower score in extraversion.
