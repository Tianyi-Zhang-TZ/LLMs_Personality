Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 3.8

The person exhibits high levels of conscientiousness, demonstrated by their meticulous attention to detail, their organisational skills and their value for efficiency. Despite hurdles and challenges, they exhibited determination in seeing tasks through to the end which also indicates a strong sense of duty and responsibility. This corresponds to a high conscientiousness score.

For extraversion, the scores are slightly lower. While the person enjoys social interactions with known groups (demonstrated by their willingness to partake in after-work events) and displays empathy towards their teammates in difficult situations, they still show reservation when they're in the company of strangers. Instances like preferring a listening over a leading role in group discussions indicating some level of comfort in being an observer rather than a participator, suggests lower levels of extraversion. Hence, the score is less than that of Conscientiousness.
