Conscientiousness: 4.6 
The individual shows high conscientiousness as they frequently refer to being careful, thorough, and detail-oriented. They seem to take tasks seriously, often pushing themselves to complete tasks and checking their work to avoid mistakes. This is evident especially in their school lab work where they pay attention to avoid harmful outcomes, and how they approach challenges on their own before asking for help. However, there's slight indecisiveness noticed when handling tasks suggesting a slight reduction from the perfect score. 

Extraversion: 2.6 
The individual leans more towards introversion than extraversion. They acknowledge being shy and quiet, showing discomfort in social situations, especially when meeting new people. Although they exhibit extraverted tendencies such as being the first to approach others when others are more nervous and cheering up team members during sports games, these tendencies are circumstantial and often require them to â€œpush out of their comfort zone." Furthermore, they often analyze social situations extensively before participation and revert to their "introversion" default, thus indicating lower extraversion.
