Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 4.0 

The subject exhibited high Conscientiousness as they consistently presented themselves as organized, detail-oriented, and mindful of their obligations (in response to the questions related to Conscientiousness), whether it was cleaning up after using equipment (Q2), showing resilience by seeking help and showing commitment to tasks (Q4), down to not making impulsive decisions to achieve desires (Q8). 

Regarding Extraversion, they appear to be quite sociable and engaging, showing a general comfort in group situations (Q1, Q3). However, one could argue that their eagerness to engage socially may stem more from a desire to influence/control than a pure love of socialization. In the team experience (Q7), their motivation seemed more grounded in empathy for their team, which is considered more of an Agreeableness trait. Despite these small nuances, their overall extraversion level is still high but slightly less so than their Conscientiousness.
