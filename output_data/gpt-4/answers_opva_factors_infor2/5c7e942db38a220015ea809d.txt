Conscientiousness: 4.2 
The individual demonstrated a high level of conscientiousness through their answers. They seem to be very organized, methodical, attentive to detail, well-prepared, and have good work discipline. For instance, in question 8 the individual indicates that they are very analytical and do not typically act on impulse, suggesting careful deliberation. In question 4, they mention being self-aware and good at deciding where to put their energy. However, full rating is not given as the individuals' answers suggest there is still some room for improvement in self-discipline and organization. 

Extraversion: 2.1 
The person showed lower levels of extraversion. They tend to listen more than lead in group discussions and seem to prefer solo time to recharge, as seen in question 5. However, they report being able to cope well in social situations where they are unfamiliar with the people around them (in question 1), and are even comfortable in a leading role if needed (question 3). But in most cases, the individual prefers being alone or observing, indicating more of an introverted personality. Due to these factors, the rating leans more towards the lower end of the scale.
