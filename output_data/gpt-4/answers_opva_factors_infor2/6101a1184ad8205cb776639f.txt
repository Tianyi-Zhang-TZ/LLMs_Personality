Conscientiousness: 4.8
Extraversion: 3.7 

The person seems to score quite high on conscientiousness. They often mention following instructions carefully and strategically such as putting everything back in place after cleaning the floor, digging up more information in the face of challenging tasks, and being very mindful of entering accurate data. They also mentioned resisting impulses at work in favor of following the correct procedure. All these answers reflect a very conscientious personality. 

For extraversion, the person's score seems to be above average but not as high as their conscientiousness score. While the person mentioned enjoying meeting and interacting with new people and offered to provide emotional support to their friends and family when they were feeling down, they also admitted to taking a listening role in group discussions and deciding to skip a social after-work event - pointing to a more reserved side of their personality in certain social situations. Therefore a score of 3.7 seems more apt.
