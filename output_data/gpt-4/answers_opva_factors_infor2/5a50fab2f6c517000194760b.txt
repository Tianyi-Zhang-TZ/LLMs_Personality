Conscientiousness: 4.8
The individual frequently talks about having an ordered mind, liking lists, and paying close attention to details. As for the impulsiveness, they state they're not very impulsive and they like to take care of equipment at their work. This indicates high conscientiousness â€“ an overall sense of responsibility, organization, dependability, and persistence. However, there are times when they had to rush through their work due to a deadline, highlighting that they may not always operate with high conscientiousness but overall, the score is quite high.

Extraversion: 3.7
The person presents a balanced view of their extraversion. They enjoy social settings, learning from others, and meeting new people, suggesting high extraversion. However, they aren't always the loudest voice in a group discussion, preferring to listen and absorb information. This ability to comfortably straddle between being social and being reserved, suggest a moderately high score in extraversion. They are comfortable and often happy in social situations (they went to a party knowing no one), and they often take an active role in cheering up their team members, indications of extraversion. They are, in general, gregarious but are able to temper this depending on the situation -- showing a more introverted side when necessary.
