Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 2.6

The person has a great tendency to be cautious, reliable, and a hard worker. The stories of trying to ensure that equipment is properly used and charged, sticking it out in a volunteering activity even when asked to leave, closely attending to details and wanting to move up in position by working hard are examples of high conscientiousness. Hence, a rating of 4.2 on Conscientiousness.

On the other hand, while this person might still engage with people and can connect with them in a meaningful way, they demonstrated more reserve than extraversion. They are comfortable in social situations but they don't seem to seek them out (e.g., not keen to after-work parties, only engaging in group discussions when needed). This leans more towards the introverted side, hence, the lower rating on Extraversion.
