In the situation with a potential impulse act, they described their approach as strategic and planful instead of impulsive, showing level-headedness and forethought.

Extraversion: 2.5
The individual appeared to have introverted tendencies but does display some level of sociability and concern for others. They described themselves as reserved, self-conscious, quiet, and even uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings. They preferred to listen rather than lead in group discussions, and had mixed feelings about attending social events. However, at the same time, they showed some extraverted characteristics, such as a desire to foster relationships, willingness to lift team members' spirit, and being group-oriented. The rating hence falls in the middle, due to their manifestations of both introvert and extravert traits.
