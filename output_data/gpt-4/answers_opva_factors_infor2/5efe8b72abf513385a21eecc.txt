Conscientiousness: 4.3
Extraversion: 2.0

The respondent displays high levels of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their consistent attention to detail, strong sense of responsibility, careful decision-making, and willingness to take on challenges. This is particularly evident in their description of the way they handled workplace tasks and challenges (such as fixing a machine or organizing equipment) as well as strategizing to ask for a pay raise. Their approach to responsibilities and problems suggests a strong commitment to diligence and dependability. 

However, the respondent exhibits relatively low levels of extraversion. They consistently highlight their preference for a listening role in group discussions and their comfort in being alone or introverted. Throughout their answers, they noted feelings of discomfort in unfamiliar social situations and during encounters with large groups of people. While they mentioned occasionally stepping up when they had a unique perspective or when they felt it was necessary, their general tendency is toward introversion and caution in group situations. Therefore, the extraversion score is lower. The only element pushing the score up slightly is their willingness to step in on occasion.
