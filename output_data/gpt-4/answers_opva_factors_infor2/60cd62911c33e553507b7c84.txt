Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.0 

Reasoning: 

The subject detailed multiple instances of being thorough, diligent and systematic in the face of tasks that require attention to detail and critical situations at work. Their methodical approach, self-discipline, and tendency to think things out before acting all show a high level of conscientiousness, consistent across questions tied to this trait.

On the other hand, the individual is notably introverted, being more comfortable in reserved, listener roles than active, leadership ones in group discussions. They go out of their comfort zone at times to interact with people (such as attending a social event when new to a place, or opting to attend important social work events), but generally, they appear less at ease in such settings. These behaviors suggest a lower level of extraversion.
