Conscientiousness: 3.5 
The interviewee showed a moderate level of conscientiousness. They seem to have an understanding of their duties and responsibilities, as evidenced by their experiences at the nursing home or with medication administration. However, there are certain instances, such as the vacuum cleaner incident or the reluctance to ask for help in certain situations, that highlight that their level of organization and cautiousness could be improved. 

Extraversion: 4.5
The interviewee seems to be highly extroverted. They are definitely comfortable in social settings, both in work-related and after-work situations as they chose to mingle and join their co-workers for drinks. They described themselves as being the 'joker' in the office, showing that they prefer to be around people and enjoy engaging with others. They did, however, show a tendency to listen rather than lead in group discussions, which is why they don't receive a full score. But overall, their responses suggest they derive energy from interacting with others which is a key characteristic of extroverts.
