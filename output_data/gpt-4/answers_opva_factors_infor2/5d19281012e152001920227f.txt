Conscientiousness: 4.0 
The respondent seems to demonstrate a keen attention to detail, a willingness to accept responsibility, and a dedication to finishing a task to the best of their abilities. The individual shows a level of concern for performing tasks correctly and pushing themselves, such as in the case with the microscopy machine, their group project, and the driving license test. However, certain responses were a bit vague or disjointed, which prevented a maximum score.

Extraversion: 3.0
The responses indicate that the respondent is somewhat comfortable in unfamiliar social situations and shows effort to engage with others, as seen in their activities such as attending social events, trying to make new friends and raising others' spirits. However, the descriptions of these interactions lacked depth, and in some cases, the respondent sounded unsure and unclear in their reactions to social situations, indicating a moderate level of extraversion rather than a high one.
