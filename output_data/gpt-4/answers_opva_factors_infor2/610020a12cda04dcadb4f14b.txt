Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The subject manifested a high level of Conscientiousness through their responses. They consistently demonstrate a strong adherence to rules, pays close attention to details, and takes their commitments seriously even when facing difficulty. These traits affirm their high conscientiousness score. When discussing their work ethic and rule-following nature, they clearly take pride being diligent.

On the other hand, their extraversion score is relatively lower. While they do exhibit some characteristics of an extrovert, such as being able to rise to the occasion during "Rush" and aim to lift spirits of team members, they predominantly identify themselves as introverted. They are selective about social events (question 5), prefer to listen rather than lead in large group discussions, and describe themselves as not typically emotionally expressive. These facets suggest a lower level of extroversion. However, their openness about these traits and ability to overcome them when needed stops the rating from being too low.
