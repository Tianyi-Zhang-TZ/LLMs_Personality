Conscientiousness: 4.1
The individual showed sustained determination and resilience in the face of challenging tasks, indicating high conscientiousness. She emphasized perseverance and diligent focus, and showed a high level of detail-orientation. However, her anxiety about unexpected job situations, and refusal to challenge an undeserved promotion in favor of preserving relationships, prevent her from receiving a maximum score. 

Extraversion: 2.5
While the individual often stated she is introverted and anxious, she also provides several examples of social engagement. She often pushed through her discomfort to interact with others and became adaptable in those circumstances, taking on leadership roles and comforting colleagues. However, her reluctance to initially engage in social situations and her pronounced anxiety lower her extraversion score.
