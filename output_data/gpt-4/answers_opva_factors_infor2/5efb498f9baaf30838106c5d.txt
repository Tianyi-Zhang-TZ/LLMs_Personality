The person tends to show considerable conscientiousness given by their description of taking pleasure in the organization of work equipment (Question 2), pushing through frustrations when tasks become challenging (Question 4), being dedicated and highly attentive to tasks requiring attention to detail (Question 6), and planning out a methodical approach to obtain a desired work item (Question 8).

As such, they score average at 3.0 for extraversion.
