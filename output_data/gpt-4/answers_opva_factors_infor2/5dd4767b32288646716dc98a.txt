Conscientiousness: 3.7 
The individual shows a good amount of conscientiousness in his responses. They demonstrate tidiness as they return the borrowed equipment to its place, overcoming challenges at work that aren't within their area of expertise, and paying attention to detail even when they're distracted. However, he does seem to struggle to focus when personal issues interfere, which prevents a higher rating.

Extraversion: 4.2 
The person demonstrates quite a high level of extraversion. This person is comfortable enough to initiate conversations in unfamiliar social situations and willingly attends social events after work, despite initial discomfort or tiredness. They also listen to others in group discussions while waiting for appropriate time to voice own opinions. They also step up to support a co-worker emotionally when they're feeling down. However, they initially take a backseat role in group discussions, which slightly lowers the rating.
