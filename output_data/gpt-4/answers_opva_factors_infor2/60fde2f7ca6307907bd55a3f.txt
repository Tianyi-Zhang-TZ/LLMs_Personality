Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.0

The responses given by this individual demonstrate a high level of conscientiousness. In work situations, they often choose to follow regulations and maintain orderliness, even in cases where they are unhappy (question 4). They also regularly attend to details to avoid errors (question 6), and display a readiness to act responsibly and without compromising company rules to achieve their desired results (question 8). Therefore, a rating of 4.5 for conscientiousness seems appropriate.

On the other hand, this person seems to be somewhere in the middle of the extraversion scale. They often feel nervous or uncomfortable in social situations, as indicated in questions 1 and 3, which suggests a degree of introversion. However, they also demonstrate a capacity for sociability and enjoyment of group activities, showcasing optimism and fun when engaged in social settings (question 5). They also display empathy by providing support for a struggling coworker (question 7). This mixture of characteristics implies a moderately extraverted personality, which suggests a score around 3.0 for extraversion.
