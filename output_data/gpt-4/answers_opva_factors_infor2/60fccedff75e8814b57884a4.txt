Conscientiousness: 3.7 
The individual showed a consistent pattern of desiring order and perfection in multiple situations. They also demonstrated some worry and anxiety around situations that did not meet their standards of organization or if their work was not perfect, indicative of a high level of dutifulness. However, their tendency to give up when something doesn't meet their standards could suggest slightly lower levels of resilience, leading to a less than maximum score.

Extraversion: 2.6
The individual identifies themselves as shy and often feels uncomfortable or anxious in social situations, particularly around people they don't know well. This suggests a lower level of gregariousness and assertiveness, key facets of extraversion. However, once they open up, they show outgoing and talkative behaviors, indicating they do possess some ability to be extroverted under the right circumstances. They also showed some instances where they took initiative to cheer people up or lead a group discussion, which points to some level of assertiveness and positive emotions. Overall, their extraversion score can be rated as around average, but on the lower side.
