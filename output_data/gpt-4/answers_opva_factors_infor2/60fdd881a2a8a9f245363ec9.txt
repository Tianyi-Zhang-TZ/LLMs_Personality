Conscientiousness: 4.7
The participant demonstrated high levels of conscientiousness throughout the given scenarios. They were responsible and diligent in their work, often going above and beyond the call of duty. They showed a significant level of attention to detail and strong problem-solving skills (e.g., in the situations with the kettle corn company and when they had the opportunity to get a raise). The participant also showed self-control and good ethical judgment when they opposed to act on an impulse for a personal gain at the expense of others. 

Extraversion: 3.8
The participant showed they could adapt to new social environments and take on leadership roles whenever necessary. They also demonstrated empathy and willingness to assist colleagues going through a tough time. However, the participant also showed signs of feeling uncomfortable and anxious in new social settings and hesitations before deciding to attend social work events. It appears that they might struggle a bit with larger social events but can do well in more contained social settings.
