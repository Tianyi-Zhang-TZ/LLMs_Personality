Conscientiousness: 4.7 
The respondent is highly meticulous in their work, showcasing great conscientiousness. They described themselves as a perfectionist who ensures tasks are completed fully and thoroughly. They also tend to be mindful of the consequences and implications of their actions, as reflected in their cautious approach towards work tasks especially when they are challenging. Moreover, they consider it worthwhile to prioritize tasks according to importance. The small deduction is due to their willingness to set challenging tasks aside if deemed unnecessary, which might limit their resilience to adversity.

Extraversion: 2.5
The respondent displays a balanced mix of introverted and extroverted traits. They described themselves as being socially reserved, often feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings. They also prefer not to attend after-work social events and find it uncomfortable to initiate conversations with new people. However, purveying that they derive enjoyment from making people happy, often acting as a mood booster in low morale situations, suggests some extraversion. Similarly, they indicated a willingness to take a leading role in group discussions when they possess sufficient knowledge on the subject. The score therefore represents a middle-ground, embodying their introvert-extrovert dichotomy.
