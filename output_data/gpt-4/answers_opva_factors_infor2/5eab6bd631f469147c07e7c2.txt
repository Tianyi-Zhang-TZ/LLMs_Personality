Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.0

The participant shows a high level of conscientiousness as evidenced by responses to question 2, 4, 6, and 8. The subject demonstrated attention to detail, motivation, and joy in completing tasks, planning and pushing oneself to do better. Moreover, even when demand or stakes were high (such as in questions 6 and 8), they kept focus rather than acting impulsively.

The participant exhibits a lower level of extraversion. While responses to questions 1, 3, 5, and 7 provided evidence of some extraverted behaviors (for example, in question 7, he showed capability to take a leadership role in uplifting the team spirit), the participant illustrated a more profound discomfort in social situations, especially when unfamiliar people are involved. They frequently expressed feeling awkward or uncomfortable when facing unfamiliar social situations (seen in answers to questions 1, 3, and 5). Overall, the participant seems to lean more towards introversion.
