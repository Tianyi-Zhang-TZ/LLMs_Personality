Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.0 

The individual demonstrates a high degree of Conscientiousness based on her systematic behavior, attentiveness to detail, and being rule-following. Her push to complete challenging tasks independently or by seeking help rather than disregarding them also indicates high conscientiousness. It is not a perfect score as in some situations she does not always plan out her actions and sometimes relies on others.

On the other hand, the individual scores lower on Extraversion. While she does express the desire to help others and can assume a leadership role when necessary, her typical behavior is more introverted. She is largely reserved and shy in unfamiliar social settings, prefers listening over leading in group discussions, often chooses to skip social events and expresses that her social battery can get drained. This reflects a lower degree of extraversion, hence the rating of 2.0.
