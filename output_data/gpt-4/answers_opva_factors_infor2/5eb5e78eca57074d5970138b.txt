Conscientiousness: 3.8
The respondent demonstrates some evidence of conscientiousness in their answers. For instance, they talk about pushing through discomfort at work, wrapping up a challenging project despite the hardship, or meticulously editing photos. These instances highlight their willingness to stick with tasks until completion, pay attention to details, and prioritize work tasks, which is characteristic of conscientiousness. However, the specific mentioning of trying to avoid getting sucked into buying snacks or side distractions suggest that they may struggle with impulse control at times.

Extraversion: 2.5
The respondent exhibits a mixed level of extraversion in their answers. They describe feeling uncomfortable in new social settings, such as the boarding school barbecue, the manager's party, or the bar event. Such feelings of discomfort might indicate low levels of extraversion. However, the respondent also spoke about taking a leadership role in group discussions, trying to be "reassuring" in the online school setting, and stepping up to cheer up downcast team members. These actions suggest some outgoing and assertive tendencies, which hint at some level of extraversion. Overall, this suggests the respondent may lie somewhere in the middle of the extraversion spectrum.
