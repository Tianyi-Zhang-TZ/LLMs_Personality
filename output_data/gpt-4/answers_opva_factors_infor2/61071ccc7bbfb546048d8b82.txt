Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.2

The person scored high on conscientiousness. This is evident in their attention to detail (especially in the last question related to meticulous work), their approach to handling equipment at work, dealing with challenging situations, and their tendency to avoid impulsive actions. This implies a well-organized, thoughtful person who likely follows rules and pays close attention to their duties.

For Extraversion, the person scored lower. They have a clear preference for learning and contributing in group discussions and supportive of their team members. However, they also showed a tendency to avoid social events after work and feel uncomfortable in new social situations, and typically taking the lead only when necessary. It suggests they might not enjoy being the center of attention and likely value their alone time, which is consistent with more introverted personality types.
