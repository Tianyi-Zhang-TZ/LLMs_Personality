Conscientiousness: 1.5
Extraversion: 1.5

The responses given were fairly disjointed, making it quite difficult to reliably assess the person's conscientiousness and extraversion. However, the little information obtained implies a relatively low level of both traits.

In the conscientiousness-related questions, the responses do not strongly point to a systematic and responsible personality. There are some vague suggestions that this person might attempt to do things properly (e.g. "It's hard for me to get on and I didn't like to be late"), but overall there's a lack of concrete evidence of a detail-oriented, organized, and disciplined behavior that characterizes high conscientiousness. 

For extraversion, the responses related to social situations are also unclear, not really reflecting an outgoing, socially- engaged, and energetic personality that high extraversion typically portrays. A slight hint of an introverted tendency can be detected from the fragmented response related to social comfort (e.g. "Are you bringing me down?"), thus leading to a lower rating.

However, it's worth noting the difficulty in assessing these traits accurately due to the disjointed nature of the responses. The responses are generally quite uninterpretable, hence these ratings are rather tentative. It would be advisable to reassess with clearer and more enriching responses.
