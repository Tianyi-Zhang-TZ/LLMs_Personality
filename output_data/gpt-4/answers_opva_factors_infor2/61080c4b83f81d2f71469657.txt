Conscientiousness: 3.0 
Extraversion: 2.0 

The person's Conscientiousness rating is average (3.0) because there's a mixture of instances when they're organized and dutiful like when they still disassembled equipment even when exhausted, and they complete their job staying on the steady path. But they also show tendencies to procrastinate, ignore details in tasks, and act on impulses like procrastinating their college assignment and ignoring details when making a website.

Their Extraversion rating is relatively lower (2.0) because they exhibited characteristics of an introvert more often than not. They tend to be more reserved and uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations and prefer not to take up leading roles. At work, they preferred to keep their social and work life separate, implying that they're less sociable with their coworkers. However, their willingness to perform in front of a class and their ability to listen and empathize show they do have some traits common amongst extroverts, so they're not fully introverted.
