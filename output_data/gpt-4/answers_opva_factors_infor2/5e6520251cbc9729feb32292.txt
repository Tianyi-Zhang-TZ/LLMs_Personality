Conscientiousness: 3.9
Extraversion: 2.6

The individual has a relatively high Conscientiousness ranking due to their attention to detail, consideration for others' work spaces, and ability to push through challenging tasks. Repeatedly, their responses indicated a strong sense of responsibility, diligence and efficiency suggesting that they are often committed to follow things through to their logical end. This is further emphasised by their need to do right by other people, fairness and adherence to rules and regulations all of which are standard characteristics of individuals with a high Conscientiousness score. However, their evaluative mild anxiety, especially when dealing with high stakes issues, has warranted a 3.9 rating rather than a perfect one. 

Extraversion is averaged to a modest 2.6 due to the individual's inclination towards introversion. They express discomfort in social situations where they don't know anyone else and also opted to skip an after-work social event because they felt drained after the day. However, their willingness to communicate, as demonstrated by their participation in group discussions, engagements in games, and their tendency to create conversations with others when they're going through a tough time, has granted them above the bottom score. These responses suggest their ability to adapt to different scenarios and be at least moderately social when the situation calls for it.
