Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 4.2

The personas described consistently showed a high level of conscientiousness, as per the responses in question 2, 4, 6 and 8. They demonstrated a willingness to understand tasks, broke them down to understand the details, made decisions based on the larger team's wellbeing, finishing tasks before leaving from a shift and paying extra care in a new task to avoid making mistakes. Factors of conscientiousness such as diligence, carefulness and thoroughness are visible in their behavior.

The responses related to extraversion, which are based on questions 1, 3, 5 and 7, also show a relatively high score. The persona managed to adapt to an unfamiliar setting, being comfortable jumping into a conversation, participating actively in a group discussion and knowing when to listen or when to lead. They also showed the ability to join social events and make social connections even after long working hours, as well as offering support and empathy to co-workers. However, there were instances where it was mentioned that they prefer to stay quiet or are cautious about adding fuel to any drama, highlighting a balanced approach but slightly less assertiveness, hence the somewhat lower score as compared to conscientiousness.
