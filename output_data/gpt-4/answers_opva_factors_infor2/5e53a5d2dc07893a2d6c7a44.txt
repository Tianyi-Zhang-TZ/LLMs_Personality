Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The answers provided show a high level of conscientiousness. Throughout all situations, the respondent continues to be diligent, well-organized and careful. They highlight planning, meeting responsibilities timely, maintaining order and working hard to achieve perfection, all of which are solid indicators of high conscientiousness. However, their response to the last question shows the potential for impulsive behavior which keeps them from a perfect score. 

Extraversion: 3.5
The score for extraversion is more in the middle ground. They show aspects of extraversion in terms of enjoying when they are with the right crowd and, in the context of group discussions, they are willing to participate when necessary. Also, they demonstrate the ability to be a mood enhancer for their team. However, their preference for keeping professional and personal boundaries, frequent tendency to be a listener, and somewhat reserved behavior in unfamiliar social settings show a level of introverted leaning as well. Therefore, the score can't be extremely high or low.
