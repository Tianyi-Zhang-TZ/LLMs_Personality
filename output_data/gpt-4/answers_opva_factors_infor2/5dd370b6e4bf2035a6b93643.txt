Conscientiousness: 4.6
The individual consistently mentioned habits indicating a high level of conscientiousness. For instance, putting equipment back in its place after use, pushing oneself to complete challenging tasks, paying great attention to details, and avoiding impulsive decisions in favor of contemplation and discussion. These responses indicate strong conscientious behavior, suggesting a high level of responsibility, discipline, and perseverance.

Extraversion: 2.3
The person rated low on extraversion. They consistently identified themselves as introverted and expressed discomfort in social settings with unfamiliar people. The fact that the individual choose to listen rather than lead in group discussions, prefers to skip after-work social events, and finds it challenging to raise the spirits of team members when they are feeling down all point to a lower level of extraversion. However, their willingness to motivate their team members during a difficult time and become comfortable with people they've spent time with suggests they do possess some degree of extraversion, hence the score is not at the extreme low end.
