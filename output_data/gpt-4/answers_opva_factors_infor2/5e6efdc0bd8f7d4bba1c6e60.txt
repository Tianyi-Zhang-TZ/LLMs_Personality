Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual's conscientiousness is rated as 4.0 as their responses overall indicated a higher level of attention to detail, responsibility, and dependability, particularly reflected by their work practices and behaviors. They follow procedures attentively, remember details well, don't rush into unfavorable decisions and plan things ahead of time. All of these indicate high conscientiousness. 

The extraversion score is rated as 2.5 because while the individual identifies as somewhat social and enjoys human connection, they also expressed significant discomfort and anxiety in social situations, particularly when they need to take the spotlight or initiate social interactions. They seem to be comfortable in one-on-one or small group settings, but the stress they feel when faced with speaking in front of a group or attending a larger social gathering reduces their extraversion score.
