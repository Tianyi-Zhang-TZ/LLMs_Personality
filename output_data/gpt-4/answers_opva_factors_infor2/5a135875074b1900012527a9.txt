Conscientiousness: 3.5
The respondent seems to have an average level of conscientiousness. They speak about being detail-oriented at work and ensuring things are correct before moving on, particularly in high-pressure situations. At the same time, the respondent also mentions being laid back and does not always keep their workspace organized, which are indicators of a lower level of conscientiousness. Furthermore, they discussed about an instance where they acted impulsively in a work situation, which is not characteristic of high conscientiousness. 

Extraversion: 2.0 
The respondent seems to lean towards introversion than extraversion. They mention they are not big fans of office parties and would rather be alone or in smaller social settings. They appear to be reserved and do not like loud music. However, they also exhibit behaviors of a mild-mannered extravert, e.g., attempting to lift colleagues' spirits when down and generally being open and friendlier once they warmed up to them. Even then, their inclination tends to lean more towards being introverted.
