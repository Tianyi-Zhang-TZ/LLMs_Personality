Conscientiousness: 3.6 
Extraversion: 1.6 

The person demonstrates quite high mindfulness towards details, organization, and responsibilities with the consistency of finishing tasks and paying attention to details which corresponds with conscientiousness. The person, however, shows relatively lower extraversion based on their responses. Despite being able to speak or take the leading role in group discussions, the individual leans more towards being an observer and a listener. Independency is seen throughout their answers, with preference of being alone and not really engaging or starting conversations during social occasions. The person is also not quick to offer emotional support or comfort to those feeling down but rather offers practical solutions, showing less natural affinity towards sociability. 

Please note that while these scores have been assigned based on the answers provided, the HEXCO model encompasses more components than conscientiousness and extraversion, and having one-on-one consultation would give more accurate evaluations.
