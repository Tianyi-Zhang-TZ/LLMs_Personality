Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The person consistently demonstrated a high level of conscientiousness in the given scenarios. The responses reflect attentiveness to detail, a preference for organization (e.g. putting everything back in its place at work), a sense of responsibility (e.g. pushing through on challenging tasks even under adverse conditions), and taking initiatives even when a task isn't particularly appealing (e.g. volunteering for a project no one else wanted).

Extraversion: 2.5
The individual appears to fall in the middle of the scale for extraversion. On one hand, there are instances of higher extraversion illustrated through attending a social event to celebrate a coworker or trying to lift team members' spirits. On the other hand, there are also signs of introversion, including feeling very shy, timid, and nervous in unfamiliar social settings (such as a new roller skating class or taking on a leading role in a group discussion). The mixed responses suggest an ambivert personality that may feel comfortable in both social and solitary settings depending on the circumstances.
