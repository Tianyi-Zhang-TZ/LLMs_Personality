Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.5

Conscientiousness: The person shows quite a high degree of responsibility, organization, and dependability which is evident by their attention to details, their tendency to seek help when they encounter problems, and their desire to fully understand their tasks and not act impulsively. However, their struggle with paying attention to small details can sometimes hinder their level of conscientiousness.

Extraversion: The individual tends to have mixed feelings about social situations as they described themselves as shy but simultaneously seek to engage with others by asking questions and listening. They have taken the lead in group discussions before and try to raise team members' spirits when they are down, which indicates a certain level of extraversion. However, this is balanced by their frequent avoidance of after-work social events and their preference to interact in smaller groups. Overall, they sit in the middle-ground of extraversion as they may come off as outgoing and reserved at different times.
