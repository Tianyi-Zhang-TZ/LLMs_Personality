Conscientiousness: 4.3 
The individual shows a high level of conscientiousness in his responses. He often talks about self-discipline, the importance of consistency and adhering to routines, and pushing himself to work more even when physically uncomfortable. He even goes so far as to acknowledge and own up to previous mistakes, suggesting a tendency towards reflection, a key aspect of conscientiousness. However, there is evidence of some impulsiveness present in his behaviours, which slightly lowers the rating.

Extraversion: 3.7 
The individual shows a moderate degree of extraversion in his responses. He demonstrates a certain level of comfort and enthusiasm in interacting with unfamiliar people, taking the lead in group discussions, and boosting team morale when required. This is indicative of social assertiveness and energy, traits associated with extraversion. However, his preference to keep his professional and social lives separate, as well as his self-description as socially awkward, suggest a degree of introversion, which balances out his score.
