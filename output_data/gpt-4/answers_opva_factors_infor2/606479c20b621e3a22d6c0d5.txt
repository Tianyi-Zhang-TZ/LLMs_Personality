Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.0

Rationale:
This person is extremely high on Conscientiousness. This is indicated by the meticulousness they show in tasks requiring attention to detail, taking strong ownership of tasks to ensure they're completed, and generally striving to maintain order and process, as shown in the answers to Questions 2, 4, 6, and 8. They seem very driven by a desire to meet expectations and do a thorough job.

Extraversion, on the other hand, appears to be fairly low for this person. Despite having capability and opportunities to express themselves (e.g., assuming a leading role in group situations), they consistently indicated a preference for listening and observing (Questions 1, 3, 5, 7). They also expressed discomfort and unease in social settings, particularly those involving new people or large groups. Therefore, the lower rating on Extraversion reflects this introverted disposition.
