Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual showed a strong self-awareness and dedication to the tasks they are given and ensures they are completed to the best of their abilities. They consistently ask for help when needed, pay close attention to instructions, and show a significant commitment to the high standard of work. Examples are reorganizing the equipment at work or passing a task to management if they are unable to complete it in time. They also exhibit the appropriate discipline and control over their impulses when they desire something, suggesting a high level of conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.5 
The individual demonstrates a balanced level of extraversion. They appear comfortable and open in unfamiliar social situations and actively partake in after-work social events - which are indicators of a certain level of extraversion. They also demonstrate empathy and consideration towards their coworkers' feelings, which suggests a level of interpersonal sensitivity often related to extraversion. However, they also mention being an introvert and a rather reserved and quiet person who listens more than speaking in group discussions. So, their level of extraversion seems somewhat mixed. They seem to exhibit situational extraversion, that is, being more outgoing and socially engaged depending on the circumstances and the people they interact with, while still cherishing their introverted qualities.
