Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 4.4

The individual scores highly on Conscientiousness because they often refer to their sense of responsibility, commitment to quality, and ability to plan and organize. For instance, in their answers for questions 2 and 4, they exhibit a strong sense of duty, carefulness and desire to do a task rightly and thoroughly. They emphasize needing to ensure everything is in good working order, wanting to own their tasks, and learning from challenges rather than pushing them aside. Their detail orientation is also evident in their response to question 6.

The individual also scores highly on Extraversion as they display a tendency towards active, outgoing behaviors and demonstrate a high level of comfort in social situations. They clearly mention their propensity to take the lead and involve themselves actively in groups discussions as evidenced in questions 1 and 3. Moreover, their willingness to participate in after-work events to strengthen bonds with coworkers (question 5) and their proactive steps in boosting team morale (question 7) indicate a high degree of sociability and assertiveness. However, due to the mention that they don't often get invited to a lot of after-work social events, the score of Extraversion is slightly lower than Conscientiousness.
