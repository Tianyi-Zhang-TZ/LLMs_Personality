Conscientiousness: 4.3
The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness. They often recall instances where they took charge of situations (e.g., completing tasks, arranging buffet items, and maintaining cleanliness in a workspace) and thoroughly stepped up to handle tasks with a perfectionist approach. They also show meticulousness and a strong sense of responsibility in their work, suggesting the importance they place on accuracy and orderliness. However, due to an instance of acting impulsively when they wanted a cigarette during a difficult work time, the score is not completely maximal.

Extraversion: 3.6
The individual has an average to slightly above average level of extraversion. They occasionally seek out social interactions and seem comfortable expressing their views in groups (e.g., in buffet planning and lifting the spirits of colleagues), indicating some level of social assertiveness. But they also revealed a tendency to be shy and reserved, especially in unfamiliar social settings, and often prefer others to make the first step in establishing friendships. Additionally, the individual shows some tendency towards being taciturn and has some level of self-consciousness when in social environments. Therefore, their extraversion rating leans more towards the middle of the scale because there’s a balance in the individual’s outgoing and reserved behavioral tendencies.
