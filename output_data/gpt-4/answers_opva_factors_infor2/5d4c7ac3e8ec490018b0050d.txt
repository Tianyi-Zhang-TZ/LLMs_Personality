Conscientiousness: 3.8 
The respondent seems to be fairly conscientious. They indicate that they are willing to learn and adapt when taking on new responsibilities (printer ink change, learning new graphic program). They also show attention to detail while learning a new computer program and express the sense of fairness when facing a challenge instead of shedding it onto others. However, the explanations are sometimes scattered indicating that they might have occasional difficulties focusing or structuring their tasks. 

Extraversion: 3.4 
The person exhibits a fairly average level of extraversion. They are generally comfortable in social settings, such as participating in an open mic poetry group while being initially shy, attending an after-work party when not knowing many people there, as well as taking on leadership and support roles (hosting an open mic event and being supportive during a crisis). However, they also consistently refer to initial nervousness or discomfort in social situations, which suggests a slight introverted tendency. They may need some time to adapt before fully expressing themselves in new social settings.
