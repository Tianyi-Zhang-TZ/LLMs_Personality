Conscientiousness: 4.8
Extraversion: 4.5

The individual demonstrated an extremely high level of conscientiousness through their detailed responses as well as their focus on orderliness, responsibility and diligence. Their adherence to routine and systems and their thorough, systematic approach indicates a very high score.

Their level of extraversion is similarly high. They feel comfortable in leading group discussions, they enjoy social settings and try to uplift team members in case of lowness. They don’t mind taking the stage when need arises but also give importance to effective listening. They balance between taking up space and offering it to others in group scenarios. Their score isn’t quite a perfect 5 because there are instances of introspection and pause before action rather than a constant outward-facing approach.
