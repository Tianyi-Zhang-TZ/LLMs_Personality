Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual frequently demonstrates conscientiousness by placing emphasis on keeping things neat at work, attention to detail, acting with integrity, and feeling responsible for their tasks, even in challenging situations. They display a strong sense of commitment, are diligent and show a willingness to follow rules, as well as an intolerance for allowing things to fall aside or neglect their responsibilities. However, there are instances where they delegate tasks when they struggle which prevents a perfect score.

Extraversion: 2.3
While the individual fluctuates between periods of introverted and extroverted behavior based on the situation, they more often identify as reserved or shy. They show willingness to engage in social situations when they feel comfortable or see a clear benefit (e.g., free food, a chance to get to know people). Nevertheless, there is a significant degree of reluctance, self-acknowledged shyness, and preference for being a listener rather than a leader in conversations. Their lack of initiative in raising the team spirit and self-admitted shyness in unfamiliar social settings further reflects their lower extraversion score.
