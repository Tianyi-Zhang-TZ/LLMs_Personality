Conscientiousness: 4.5
The individual displayed a high level of conscientiousness through his careful attention to detail, as noted in Question 6. This individual takes responsibility for fixing issues and learning more about unfamiliar areas, such as Question 4. He doesn't give into impulses at work, but instead thoroughly discusses and plans when faced with tasks or challenges as demonstrated in question 8. These are all traits indicative of a highly conscientious personality.

Extraversion: 2.0
Expressions throughout the responses suggest a preference for quiet, solitary activities, and discomfort in social situations. In Question 1, 3, and 5, he mentions feeling uncomfortable or inclined to decline when invited to social events. Also in Question 7, when his team members were feeling down, he tried to be pragmatic rather than boosting their spirits, which also indicates a lower score in extraversion. However, this person is not entirely withdrawn as demonstrated in Question 3 by participating in discussions as a listener which shows some engagement in social situations. Thus, the score is not at the lowest level.
