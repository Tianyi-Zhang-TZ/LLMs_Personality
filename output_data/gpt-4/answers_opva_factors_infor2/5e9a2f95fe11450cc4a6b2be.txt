Conscientiousness: 4.8 
The interviewee demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness in their work based on their responses. They have mentioned being detail-oriented, organized, and analytical- putting back unused items, ensuring tasks are completed correctly without passing it onto someone else, and persisting in a long process to get a job they desired. They also show an ability to adapt well to new situations. However, the lack of perfect score is due to occasional moments of hesitance, doubt, and indecision which indicates that there could be a small room for improvement.

Extraversion: 2.5
The interviewee has mixed attributes of introversion and extraversion. They describe themselves as socially awkward and seem to struggle in unfamiliar social situations where they don't know anyone, often opting out of activities where they would be exposed to such situations. However, they also mention taking on the role of the 'sunshine of the store', uplifting team membersâ€™ spirits and leading team discussions, reflecting some features of extraversion. Hence, middle-of-the-scale rating seems pertinent, indicating an ambivert personality.
