Conscientiousness: 3.0 
The person seems conscientious in some situations and less so in others. For instance, they took the initiative to clean up gym equipment at work and wrestled with the impulse to spend money on online shopping during working hours - an indicator of a stable personality trait. However, they also showed lackadaisical behavior, as seen when they were dealing with school tasks and tests that required attention to detail. These instances lower their conscientiousness score.

Extraversion: 4.0 
The person appears to be moderately extroverted. They recalled feeling slightly uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings. Still, they took the initiative to integrate themselves into a group at a party and were assertive and proactive in leading group discussions in school. At the gym, they interacted positively with coworkers and clients, maintained leadership roles, and intervened to boost team spirit when needed. Though they mentioned feeling anxiety in unfamiliar social situations, overall, their demonstrated behavior is more on the extroverted side.
