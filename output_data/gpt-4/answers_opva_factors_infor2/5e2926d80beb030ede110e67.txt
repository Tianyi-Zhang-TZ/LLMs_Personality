Conscientiousness: 4.8
Extraversion: 4.3

The individual demonstrates high levels of Conscientiousness by showing keen attention to detail, as displayed in question 6 where they explain their approach to detail-oriented tasks. They reportedly invest a lot of effort into their work and set challenges for themselves and work past their discomfort to meet their targets, as seen in their response to question 2 (learning to use a cash register proficiently) and question 4 (taking on a challenge in public speaking). They also adopt a methodical approach to tasks, actively trying to avoid mistakes undertaking their duties at work (question 2 and question 6).

With regards to Extraversion, the individual displays a preference for being sociable and interacting with others. From their responses, it's evident that they feel comfortable meeting new people given their approach in question 1 to get to know people at an unfamiliar social setting, they enjoy attending after-work social events (question 5), and also derive satisfaction from uplifting the spirits of their colleagues (question 7). However, they also expressed needing a little push (like a drink or a few known faces) to feel comfortable in social settings, which is why the score is slightly lower than Conscientiousness. 
Overall, this individual seems to demonstrate high levels of both Conscientiousness and Extraversion.
