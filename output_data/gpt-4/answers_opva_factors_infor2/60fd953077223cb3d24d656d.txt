Conscientiousness: 4.2 
Extraversion: 3.5 

The individual shows high conscientiousness through meticulousness in the care of their equipment and desire for order, the willingness to ask for help when tasks get too challenging, attention to details to avoid making mistakes, and being strategic about seeking a raise. There are moments of impulsivity that slightly pull down the overall score, but the overall evidence leans on the higher end of the spectrum. 

As for extraversion, the individual demonstrates an active interest in social interactions and takes upon a leading role in group discussions whenever they feel comfortable. However, there is also evidence of significantly higher comfort levels in familiar environments and with known people. Their level of discomfort and nervousness in less-known, less-familiar environments indicates a somewhat reserved nature, pulling down the overall extraversion score somewhat. Overall, I would categorize them as moderately extroverted.
