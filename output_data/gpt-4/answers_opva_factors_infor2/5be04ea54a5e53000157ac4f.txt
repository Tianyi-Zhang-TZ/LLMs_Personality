Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.8

The given answers indicate a moderately high Conscientiousness score. Throughout the responses, the person repeatedly shows that they attempt to complete tasks to the best of their ability, pay attention to detail, organize themselves, and work hard to achieve their goals. These are all values that correspond to a conscientious personality.

However, the Extraversion score is less optimal. The person seems to feel somewhat comfortable in social settings where they don't know people, which indicates a level of sociability and assertiveness. However, responses also show that they tend to avoid after-work social events and they also prefer to listen in group discussions rather than taking on a leading role. These factors arguably reduce their extraversion score. Despite this, the individual does show a willingness to engage with others, particularly in terms of raising people's spirits, which prevents the score from being too low.
