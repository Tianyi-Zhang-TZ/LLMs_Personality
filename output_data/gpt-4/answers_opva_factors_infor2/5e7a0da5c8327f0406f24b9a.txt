Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The respondent has demonstrated a high level of conscientiousness throughout their responses. They illustrate this through an inclination towards careful and orderly conduct in many situations. They show meticulous attention to detail, the desire to maintain organization and their ability to push themselves while prioritizing task completion and orderliness. Furthermore, they seem to exhibit a substantive amount of deliberation before taking actions, such as when they refrained from impulsive behavior before asking for a raise, further indicative of their deemed level of conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 2.5 
The respondent exhibits characteristics of introversion in multiple answers indicating discomfort in social situations where they did not know anyone, maintaining a reserved demeanor during group discussions and often defaulting to a listening role. However, they have shown elements of extraversion, making connections with others based on common interests, stepping up into leadership roles when necessary and trying to uplift teammates when they are feeling down. They indicate variability and appear to straddle the line between both introversion and extraversion thus demonstrating ambivalent traits. So, it would seem suitable to provide a moderate rating.
