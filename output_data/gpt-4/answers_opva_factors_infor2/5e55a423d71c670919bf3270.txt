Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 3.5

Reasoning: The subject showed a high level of Conscientiousness as they demonstrated being diligent and careful in tasks, such as returning equipment at work and attentively matching wood layers for a detailed project. They also illustrated the trait of responsibility by choosing to handle a heavy boat alone to avoid burdening colleagues. Their ability to avoid acting impulsively when desiring a particular group at work also evidences a good degree of self-control.

However, the subject was relatively less extraverted. While they communicated easily when familiar with the people around, such as with friends at work or team members in high school, they described an initial uncomfortable feeling in new social settings until they could find a way to break the ice. They also chose not to join after work social events due to personal comfort levels. However, their willingness to lead discussions and motivate others suggests that they do have some qualities associated with extraversion. Thus, their Extraversion rating is slightly lower than their Conscientiousness rating.
