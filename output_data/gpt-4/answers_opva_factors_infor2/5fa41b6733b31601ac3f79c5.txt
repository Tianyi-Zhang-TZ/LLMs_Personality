Conscientiousness: 4.8 
The respondent shows a high degree of diligence and responsibility in their descriptions of work situations. This is evidenced by their careful approach to detail (e.g., paying attention to even a penny error in financial responsibilities), taking the lead in problem-solving (i.e., fixing the copier), not shying away from challenging tasks, and their goal-oriented, assertive action to secure a committee position at work.

Extraversion: 4.5 
The individual demonstrates a good mix of sociability and assertiveness. This is seen in their willingness to connect with others in social events (e.g., wedding reception), assuming a leading role during group discussions, boosting team morale during stressful work periods, and being able to adapt between listening and leading according to group needs. However, they also mention enjoying alone time after work, which suggests a bit of reservation in their extraversion.
