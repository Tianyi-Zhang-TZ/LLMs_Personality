Conscientiousness: 4.7 
The interviewee showed high conscientiousness as they often described how detail-oriented they are when it comes to their work, especially in tasks that need keen attention. Furthermore, their responses exhibit their ability to plan ahead rather than act impulsively, showing their discipline and prudence. They also express a dedication to their work, which points to their consistent aim for achievement.

Extraversion: 4.5
The interviewee showed high extraversion, as they often mentioned being comfortable in social scenarios, whether it was at a party with strangers or in after-work social events. They were also comfortable leading and speaking in group discussions and have displayed great interpersonal skills, willingly stepping in to help others at work or to elevate their mood with humour. They also expressed an ability to express themselves openly, indicating strong assertiveness, an aspect of extraversion. However, as they aged and their social circle changed, it seems there is a slight hesitation in social behavior compared to their younger years. Hence, not a perfect score.
