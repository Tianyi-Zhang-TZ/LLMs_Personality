Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual's answers indicate a high level of conscientiousness. They displayed a sense of responsibility, self-discipline, and a desire to complete tasks to a high standard, such as when they spoke about wanting to clean a disorganized closet at work (Q2) despite feeling it wasn't solely their responsibility, putting a lot of attention into making sure they didn't make mistakes (Q6), and their initiative in applying for a promotion even when they felt unsure (Q8).

Extraversion: 2.0 
The individual showed lower degrees of extraversion. They reported frequent discomfort in social settings and a tendency to avoid initiating conversation (Q1). Though they did participate in group discussions at work, they often take a listening role (Q3) and have admitted being more of a follower than a leader in social situations (Q7). However, they did exhibit some willingness to push themselves into somewhat uncomfortable situations for personal growth, such as attending social work events (Q5), which prevents the score from being lower.
