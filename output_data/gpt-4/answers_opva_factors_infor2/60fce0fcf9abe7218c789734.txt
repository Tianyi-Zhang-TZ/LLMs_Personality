Conscientiousness: 3.5 
Extraversion: 2.0 

Conscientiousness: This individual is moderately conscientious based on the responses given. They displayed a desire for organization and attention to detail, and tend to focus on tasks at hand to avoid mistakes. However, there were instances in the responses where they struggled with control and becoming overwhelmed. They tried to act assertively when they believed they deserved a promotion but unfortunately, they failed in the attempt. This suggests that while they have elements of a conscientious personality, they may require some work to handle difficult situations better.

Extraversion: The individual's responses suggest more introverted tendencies. This can be seen in their discomfort in unfamiliar social situations and preference for listening rather than leading in group discussions. They tend to avoid after-work events and feel nervous when confronting a superior at work. However, they also showed instances of being comfortable around people they are close to and trying to lift up the morale of their team. This suggests they have the capacity for extraversion but generally lean towards introversion in most situations.
