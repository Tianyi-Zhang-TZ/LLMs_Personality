Conscientiousness: 4.7
Extraversion: 3.5

The participant demonstrated high conscientiousness (4.7) demonstrated through a strong work ethic, meticulousness in completing tasks, extreme attention to detail, and the ability to act with restraint, even when it comes against their personal desires. They also exhibited a willingness to take responsibility for their work and to strive for perfection, particularly in reference to their job as a software developer. This comes off in the manner they strive for accuracy in client expectations, keeping the workspace organized, and adapting their working style to accommodate high-focus tasks.

For Extraversion, the participant was moderately extroverted (3.5). Despite describing themselves as "socially awkward" and expressing preference for isolated work, they still maintained the capability of interacting with clients face-to-face and made efforts to be outgoing in such high-pressure situations. Their ability to actively participate or even lead group discussions also points toward some level of extraversion. However, they also exhibited a preference for quieter situations, such as focusing on work and preferring to stay home rather than attend social events.

This assessment is subjective and based on the participant's self-reported behaviors and attitudes in various situations. Some responses may not fully represent their overall personality or how they would behave in different contexts.
