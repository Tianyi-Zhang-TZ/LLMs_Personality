Extraversion: 4.7 

The individual has shown a high Conscientiousness score as she consistently illustrated her organization skills, attention to detail, and determination. This includes her preference for keeping clean and organised, her desire to handle complex tasks herself, her meticulous nature in her work tasks and her lack of impulsiveness when it comes to important decisions at work. She shows a strong sense of diligence and responsibility. 

Regarding Extraversion, the individual demonstrated a high level of comfort and enjoyment in social situations, strong conversational skills and a tendency to step into leadership roles in group discussions. The individual even further demonstrated her high score on the extraversion factor by stating that she really enjoys socializing and meeting new people, even when in a scenario where she doesn't know anyone at all.
