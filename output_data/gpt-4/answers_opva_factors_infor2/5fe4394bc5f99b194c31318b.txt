Conscientiousness: 4.3
The respondent often shows a high degree of diligence and the tendency to act in an organized or thoughtful way. This is evident in their careful attention to detail, their commitment to seeing tasks through to successful completion, and their ability to plan and strategize effectively. These are all key indicators of conscientiousness. They consistently put their equipment away in its rightful place, took charge in group projects to ensure high quality standards, and took on challenging tasks rather than passing them off to someone else. However, they also mentioned impulse actions which impede the full score.

Extraversion: 3.4
The respondent appears to enjoy social interactions and being around other people, but also places a high value on personal time and self-care. This is seen in their willingness to take a leader role but also knowing when to take a step back and look after themselves and their personal needs. Encouraging team members when they were down also indicates some levels of extraversion. However, they also expressed discomfort in initial social situations and demonstrated a preference for selective social interactions, hence the score is not at the extreme high end.
