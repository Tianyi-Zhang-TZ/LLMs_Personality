Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Your responses consistently demonstrate a strong sense of duty, organization, and reliability. You show responsibility towards your tasks and always try to complete it in a timely and efficient manner. You have shown that you can remain steady and focused under pressure, even turning frustration into a driving force. With good self-discipline, you seem to have the ability to push beyond the point of temporary inconvenience when you want to accomplish a higher goal. 

Extraversion: 3.5 
You seem like an ambivert who displays a balanced mix of introvert and extrovert qualities. You describe yourself as initially shy in social situations and more comfortable once you get to know people. Yet, you've taken courage many times to get yourself out of the comfort zone, to connect with others, to lead group discussions, and to raise the spirit of your team members, reflecting a well-functioning level of social assertiveness and friendliness. Your rating is lower because your social interactions appear to be often accompanied by a high level of self-consciousness and some anxious feelings. Even so, you have clearly demonstrated an ability to adapt and become more outgoing under certain circumstances.
