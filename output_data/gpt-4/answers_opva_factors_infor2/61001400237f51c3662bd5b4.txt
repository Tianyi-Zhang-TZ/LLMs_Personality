Conscientiousness: 4.7 
The individual frequently describes themselves as well-organized, meticulous, and self-reliant. They are stringent in their workplace and stress on tidiness, cleanliness, and stationing things back in place. The individual also identifies as a perfectionist and holds high standards for themselves and their work. They express difficulty in delegating tasks due to a strong belief in their work ethic. However, there is also an element of impulse in their decision-making, indicating that they may sometimes neglect deliberation. Altogether, these traits strongly indicate a high level of conscientiousness; however, the occasional impulsivity detracts from a perfect score. 

Extraversion: 4.8 
The individual stands out as outgoing and comfortable entering and leading social situations. They exhibit vivacity and open communication, actively partaking in group discussions and assuming a facilitatory role. Their ability to easily interact with people at work to the point of enjoyment and the tendency to step up to cheer others up when morale is low reflects their sociability and warmth. These characteristics suggest a highly extroverted personality. The only minor setback is their commentary on occasional struggles to connect with people of their own age, which stops just short of a perfect rating.
