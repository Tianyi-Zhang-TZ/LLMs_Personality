Conscientiousness: 4.3 
The individual exhibits considerable commitment to orderliness, responsibility, and attention to detail in the workplace tasks providing clear evidence of strong Conscientiousness. Despite the description of nervousness in the face of challenge, the individual highlighted persistent determination to overcome obstacles and deliver high quality work. This display of diligence and regulation against impulses also supports a high Conscientiousness rating. However, the description of an approach to stress and challenges that's characterized by some nervousness suggests that the individual might still be working on overall emotional resilience, hence the deduction from a perfect score.

Extraversion: 2.3 
The individual shows a clear preference for listening over leading and for solitude over social engagement which suggest a quieter and more introverted persona. They also express discomfort with the role of a 'spirit lifter' in the team, which is often a task taken up by more extraverted individuals. However, the individual also reported being flattered by the invitation to a social event and showed willingness to step up to leadership roles when necessary. These qualities, although evidently not the personâ€™s preferred modus operandi, suggest a degree of social interest, communication and assertiveness that bring up the Extraversion rating from the lower end of the scale.
