Conscientiousness: 4.8
The person demonstrated a very high level of conscientiousness. They consistently spoke about liking the organization, paying close attention to details, never leaving assignments unfinished, always putting things back to their place, and being meticulous and deliberate in their actions. Even in a tough situation where an impulse action would be beneficial, they seem hesitant due to their structured personality. They also express enjoyment in structure, order and hard work, emphasizing a drive towards achievement and dependability — all clear signs of conscientiousness. The score was not a perfect 5.0 as some responses indicated that they can struggle when faced with impulsiveness or disruptions to routines.

Extraversion: 4.5
The person demonstrated quite high extraversion. They shared that they often take on leading roles, connect with girls around them, concentrate on making other people feel comfortable, and always join social events. They also know how to turn up positive facets of their personality, see themselves as charismatic, welcoming and warm to others, and like to make people laugh. They put their own discomfort aside and focus on others’ comfort which signifies a high level of sociability and positive emotions. The slight deduction is due to their expressed necessity for listening and compassion, which might suggest they sometimes avoid the assertive, boisterous behavior present in extremely extroverted people.
