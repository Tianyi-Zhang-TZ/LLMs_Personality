Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 3.5

Explanation:
Conscientiousness is given a high score because the individual respects rules and aims to fulfill responsibilities fully, as seen in Question 2 when they try to leave things better than they found them and in Question 4 where they demonstrate a penchant for ownership of their own work. They also show a dedication to being meticulous in their work in Question 6. However, the score is not at the maximum, as they also admit to needing help or taking more time on tasks when needed.

Extraversion gets a moderately high score. The respondent acknowledges discomfort in unfamiliar social situations (Question 1), and a preference for shorter durations at social events (Question 5), signaling some introverted qualities. But they also showcase qualities associated with Extraversion, such as opening up to othersâ€“taking a balanced role in group discussions (neither dominating nor becoming a wallflower, as seen in Question 3). They show concern for their team members' well-being (Question 7). Therefore, Extraversion's score is slightly above average.
In conclusion, this individual possesses higher Conscientiousness traits, while their range on the Extraversion scale is quite balanced, leaning towards moderate extraversion.
