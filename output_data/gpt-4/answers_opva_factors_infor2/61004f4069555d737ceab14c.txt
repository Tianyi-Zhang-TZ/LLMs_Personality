Conscientiousness: 4.7
The individual displays a strong sense of responsibility, attention to detail, and an ability to make a plan and follow through with it. They show their conscientious nature through their actions, such as returning equipment to the rightful owner, pushing themselves harder when faced with challenging tasks, paying attention to details to avoid making mistakes, and not acting impulsively when they want something badly at work. They prefer to carefully consider options and impacts first.

Extraversion: 2.3
The individual seems to be more introverted but is able to navigate social situations when required. They are more comfortable in social settings where they know the people around them and often assume a listening role during group discussions. In situations where team members are feeling down, they are prepared to listen and offer solutions, showing some qualities of an introverted personality. In a setting where they didn't know anyone, they felt uncomfortable but managed to respond and react when appropriate. Their tendency to avoid or skip social events with people they're not close to may also indicate shyness and reserve, further confirming lower levels of extraversion.
