They navigate challenging situations with a grit to not surrender, are quite meticulous in their roles, and take care to place everything in their right places. They also weigh their options before making impulsive decisions. However, they do admit to making mistakes when asked to focus on nuances, which slightly affects their Conscientiousness score. 

Extraversion: 4.5
The person seems to find energy in social settings, generally attempting to cast a favorable impression on others and initiate conversations. They show an inclination to both lead and listen during group discussions, are usually outgoing and go-to after-work social events, and have a strong inclination to uplift the spirits of team members.

However, a small point of hesitation is seen in their tendency to sometimes decide their participation based on personal perks and lack of connection due to language barriers, which lowered their score slightly.
