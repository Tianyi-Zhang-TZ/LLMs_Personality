Conscientiousness: 4.8
The person displays a high level of conscientiousness in all the related questions. They illustrate a clear tendency to follow rules, pay keen attention to detail, complete tasks, take responsibility and also demonstrates a demonstrated concern for others - all core aspects of conscientiousness. Their inclination towards double-checking work indicates their dedication to avoiding errors. Their reluctance to act impulsively and their willingness to tackle difficult tasks implies a high sense of duty and reliability. However, the slight deduction is due to a certain level of struggle with delegation, which is also part of conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.6
The person shows characteristics of both an introvert and an extrovert, in different situations, indicating they may fall into the category of an ambivert. They describe being uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and missing after-work social events, which are more introverted tendencies. However, they also speak about their ability to converse, ask questions, make connections, and motivate others in the latter part of the responses, including taking a leadership role within group discussions, indicating extroverted qualities. The rating is slightly above the midpoint due to more exhibition of extraverted traits in professional circumstances. However, their comfort in solitude and apprehension towards extending work relationships into personal friendships have anchored the rating from going any higher.
