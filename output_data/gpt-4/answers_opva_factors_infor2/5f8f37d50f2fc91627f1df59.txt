Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.2

The score for Conscientiousness is slightly higher due to the person's clear sense of responsibility and detail-oriented approach in situations regarding task completion. Evidence of this is seen when the person ensures to put equipment back exactly where it was after usage and meticulously inspecting the library room. Moreover, the person evidently exercises self-control in managing potentially impulsive behaviors by restraining from consuming food from the break room during work hours. However, there were also suggestions that the person gets easily frustrated and distracted, reducing the Conscientiousness score slightly.

The Extraversion score is mid-range as the respondent showed a mix of sociable and reserved tendencies. The person seems to desire a balance between listening and leading in group discussions, and tends to be reserved during unfamiliar social situations, but they enjoyed relaxing with friends and are likely to attend social events. They do not seem to take the initiative to boost team morale, possibly because they are also impacted by the low morale. The Extraversion score is thus moderately high, reflecting this balance of traits.
