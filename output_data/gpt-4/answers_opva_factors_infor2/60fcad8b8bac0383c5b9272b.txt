Conscientiousness: 4.7
This person seems to be diligent and well-organized. They consistently described a tendency towards responsibility, a strong work ethic, being detail-oriented and a tenacious approach to challenges. An instance includes their refusal to let their husband take over a frustrating task because they want to do it themselves and maintain their own standards of perfection. These point to high conscientiousness. I did not rate it a perfect 5 because there are moments when the individual's own standards or interests may impede adaptability or efficiency.

Extraversion: 2.3
This individual described themselves as an introvert, often needing time alone to recharge after social interactions. However, they also showed a capacity to be sociable and outgoing when the situation calls for it, such as when leading a group discussion or boosting the morale of team members, which displays an adaptability. While they seem to have developed coping mechanisms to act extroverted when necessary, it is clear that their natural inclination is towards introversion. Thus, their Extraversion score is moderately low.
