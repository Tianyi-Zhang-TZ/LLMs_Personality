Conscientiousness: 4.1
The individual demonstrates conscientiousness in most of their responses. Notably, they detail a situation where they purposely put equipment back in place at work â€“ indicative of being diligent, meticulous, and responsible. There's also an inclination towards paying close attention to details in their work, as mentioned in their role in research studies. Yet, there's a moment of impulsivity in a situation at work where they wanted shredded cheese, which slightly reduces the score. 

Extraversion: 2.8
The person seems to be rather introverted in their responses. They describe instances where they were in unfamiliar social settings and opted to keep to themselves or decline invitations for social gatherings. Even when they took a leadership role in their school project, they didn't describe it in terms of engaging with or motivating their peers, which would suggest higher extraversion. The willingness to lead, however, does suggest some measure of assertiveness, a factor of extraversion. Thus, while they get a lower score on extraversion due to their preference for less social interaction, the score is not extremely low due to their ability to take charge in certain situations.
