Conscientiousness: 5.0
Extraversion: 2.0

The individual in question shows maximum traits of conscientiousness. They subscribe to very high standards of detail orientation, are highly organized as evidenced by the description of returning work equipment to its original state, and work beyond the call of duty when a situation calls for it. The recounting of working relentlessly to finish an important job all night long indicates an extreme level of conscientiousness. 

On the other side, they show some lack of extraversion. The individual tends to be nervous in new social settings with unknown people, is more of a listener rather than a speaker in group situations, and chooses to be selective in socializing with co-workers. They are compassionate and would reach out to friends who are feeling down, showing some elements of social desirability that fits with extraversion. However, overall, their introverted tendencies are more pronounced, indicating a lower rating in this regard.
