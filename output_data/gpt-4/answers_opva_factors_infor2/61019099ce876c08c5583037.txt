Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The interviewee has shown high conscientiousness based on the claim of strict organization skills, strong tendency of being detail-oriented, and responsible behavior in work settings, such as putting equipment back in its place for the next person. They also show ability to proceed thoughtfully rather than behaving impulsively, which signifies an inclination towards disciplined, deliberate, and efficient work ethics. 

Extraversion: 3.0 
While they enjoy social events and take an active role in social interactions like uplifting teammates’ spirits, they also express experiencing certain uneasiness when in unfamiliar social scenarios. This signifies the person is an ambivert—someone who displays characteristics of both extroverts and introverts. When it comes to leading group discussions, they would rather act as a listener unless they are very confident about the subject, indicating a level of reservedness. Yet the self-stated efforts undergoing to overcome shyness and building confidence indicate growth in terms of extroversion. Overall, they seem to be in the middle of the spectrum between introversion and extroversion.
