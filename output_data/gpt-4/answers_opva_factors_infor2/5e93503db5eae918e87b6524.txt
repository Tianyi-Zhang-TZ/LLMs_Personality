Conscientiousness: 4.8
The individual has consistently shown an inclination towards problem solving, attention to detail and making a genuine attempt to handle challenging tasks. They have a high level of responsibility, displayed through their actions of trying to find solutions and being task-oriented in situations where it would be easier to pass off the challenge. However, there are instances of them being careful and restrained when it comes to following impulses, showing an ethical and just approach. This restraint prevents a perfect rating, but the score is high due to the overall sense of responsibility, perseverance, and attention to detail.

Extraversion: 3.2
The person displayed varied characteristics of both an introvert and an extrovert. While there is quite an evidence of avoidance behavior in new social situations or optional social events, they also showed elements of leadership and empathy especially within the context of familiar people or their work environment. They seem more comfortable in one-on-one or small-scale interactions, especially when there is a sense of shared experience or emotion. They are willing to step up and take a central role when it comes to getting work done. Their selective sociability and introverted tendencies in some social contexts prevent a higher score.
