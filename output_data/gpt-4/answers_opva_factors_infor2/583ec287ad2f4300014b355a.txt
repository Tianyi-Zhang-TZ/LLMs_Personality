Conscientiousness: 2.8 
The individual mentioned delegation when tasks were beyond his comfort zone (Question 4), and also exhibited neglect in taking responsibility when faced with a task that required meticulous attention and consideration (Question 6). However, he was somewhat diligent in managing a project where he had to ensure that the deliverables were on time (Question 3) and assertively advocated for his full-time position (Question 8), showing some attention to work obligations and achievement.
 
Extraversion: 1.5 
The person distinctly described their introverted nature multiple times (Question 1 and 5) and the discomfort they experience in social situations, especially those that call for mingling with strangers or large groups. They also refrained from uplifting team spirit in a dismal situation (Question 7), further demonstrating their lack of sociability, gregariousness, and assertiveness that are typical in extroverts. They expressed discomfort in asserting themselves (Question 3), which overall suggests low extraversion. Although there was some assertive behavior when he was delegated in a leading role in a project (Question 3), it does not significantly elevate the extraversion score as his overall orientation veers largely towards introversion.
