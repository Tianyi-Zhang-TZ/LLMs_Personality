Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 2.5

Based on the given answers, the subject seems to have a high level of Conscientiousness -- they take their duties seriously and strive to do their best work. They carefully plan their actions to avoid making mistakes, be it in details of their work or when faced with complex tasks. They also show a sense of organization and an inclination towards making everything immaculate, as evident from their response to the question about putting back equipment in place.

For Extraversion, I offer a moderate rating based on context clues in their answers. They indicate that they tend to keep their personal and work lives separate, express preference for quiet and calm environments, and do not actively seek out social engagements with workmates. On the other hand, in group discussions, depending on the topic, the trait of assuming a leading role hints at some level of outgoing nature and ability to adjust according to the situation. Based on these answers, the subject may tend to be more introverted, but they certainly have capacity for extraversion when it suits their goals or needs. Hence, the moderate score.
