Conscientiousness: 4.8 
The respondent describes several instances where they took extra care to meet their responsibilities at work, whether it was tidying up, leading a group discussion, or tackling a challenging task. Their attention to detail in their editorial role further supports a high conscientiousness rating. Their actions indicate high levels of responsibility, organization, and persistence, all of which are key aspects of conscientiousness. However, they also mention being creative in getting what they wanted, suggesting a balance between sticking to conventions and finding novel solutions.

Extraversion: 3.6 
The respondent's answers indicate fluctuations in their level of extraversion depending on the situation they find themselves. They are outgoing in general but also express discomfort when they are put in an unfamiliar social situation. They illustrate leadership to facilitate a group discussion and are keen to support colleagues when they were down, all of which are indicative of a high level of extraversion. However, their decision to participate in social events seems to be conditioned by the size and familiarity of the group, indicating characteristics typical of an ambivert. This suggests an average to slightly above average rating in extraversion.
