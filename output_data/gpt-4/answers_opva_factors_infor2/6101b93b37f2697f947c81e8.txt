Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 4.0 

The individual demonstrated high levels of conscientiousness by showing they are organized, detail-oriented, and by-the-book. They adhere to rules and have a strong sense of duty both in return equipment to its place and taking responsibility for a challenging task. They also prove to be thorough and meticulous in eliminating errors in their work. However, it's not a full 5.0 rating due to occasional impulsive actions mentioned in question 8, where the person occasionally acts on an impulse without fully thinking it through.

Coming to extraversion, the person comes across as quite sociable, friendly, and adaptable in social situations. They are actively participating in after-work social events, taking the initiative to start conversations with strangers during the company happy hour and at times, playing a leadership role in group discussions. However, it seems like they need to push themselves to do so in these social situations, indicating they may be more naturally introverted, leading to a rating of 4.0.
