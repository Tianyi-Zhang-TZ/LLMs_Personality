Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual demonstrates a high degree of Conscientiousness. There is evidence of ability to plan and organize tasks in advance (referring to leaving things tidier than when they found it and talking about putting everything back in place). They also show a diligent attitude, especially when required to pay attention to details and avoid making mistakes (working carefully with Excel spreadsheets). They appear to understand the importance of responsibilities, and fulfill tasks even when they may be difficult or challenging (expressing the urge to push through difficult tasks rather than avoiding them). There's also an instance where the person refrain from acting on impulse at work to maintain professionalism. This disciplined, methodical and goal-oriented behavior aligns with high Conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 3.7 
Despite admitting to being initially shy in new social situations, the individual shows signs of growing comfort with social interaction over time (referring to attending after-work social events and navigating social settings in college without the comfort of their twin). They are not overly dominant in group discussions, displaying a balanced approach between listening and leading. They also demonstrate empathy and influence in a team setting, boosting team morale during a disappointing event. However, their move towards engaging in social activities seems to be more a strategic choice than innate inclination which may suggest they lean towards introversion a bit. Overall, balance between introvert and extrovert traits leans the rating towards the medium-high end.
