Conscientiousness: 2.0 
The person depicted in the answers demonstrates a lower level of conscientiousness. They often describe themselves as 'lazy', 'disorganized', and tend not to pay full attention to details, attributing more significance to the 'bigger picture'. Their impulsiveness further indicates this, reflecting a lack of thoroughness, orderliness, and dependability - key features of conscientiousness. However, in difficult situations, the person has shown the capacity for self-discipline, determination and a sense of duty, which calls for a score slightly above the lowest level.

Extraversion: 2.0 
The person's responses clearly indicate a tendency toward introversion. They express discomfort in social settings, especially with unfamiliar faces, and generally prefer to enjoy their own company or being with a few selected individuals. However, their willingness and ability to assume a leading role in group works and to enliven colleagues' spirits when they are down reflect a degree of social assertiveness and enthusiasm, thus warranting a higher score than the lowest.
