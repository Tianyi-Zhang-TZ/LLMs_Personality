Conscientiousness: 4.8
Extraversion: 4.5 

Reasoning:
The individual scores high on Conscientiousness, demonstrated by their commitment to completing tasks efficiently, paying close attention to detail, and avoiding impulsive behavior at work. Their description of pushing themselves in running and their strategy for how they managed a very busy time in their life both demonstrate a strong work ethic, thoroughness, and dedication, all traits indicative of high Conscientiousness score. Hence, the score is 4.8

Extraversion score is slightly lower but still quite high due to evidence of talkativeness, comfort in social settings, and willingness to both listen and lead in group discussions. They seem to enjoy being around others and don't hesitate to share their thoughts and experiences. The reason why it's not a perfect score is because there is also mention of feeling discomfort in situations where they can't meet the perceived expectations of others, as shown in the situation when they could not participate in the race due to injury. These moments of anxiety indicate slightly lower levels of assertiveness, leading to a score of 4.5.
