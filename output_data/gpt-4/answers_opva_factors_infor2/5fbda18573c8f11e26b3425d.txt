Conscientiousness: 4.5 
This person shows a strong sense of responsibility, organization, and diligence towards their tasks and decisions. They consistently discuss thoroughness, being orderly, setting goals and fulfilling them, and displaying self-discipline (as exemplified in responses to questions about putting equipment back in place, challenging tasks, attention to detail, and wanting something badly at work). They display a slight level of flexibility when they let others take the opportunity offered by a senior member, suggesting a high level of integrity.

Extraversion: 4.2 
The person demonstrates reasonably high extraversion as they seem comfortable in social settings and often take the initiative to engage with others (see responses about social settings, group discussions, and dealing with downcast team members). They typically assume leadership roles and enjoy the company of others, as seen in their decision to join an after-work event. However, their extraversion might not be at the maximum level since there's evidence suggesting a bit of initial discomfort or anxiety in new environments or with unfamiliar people, and they also describe themselves as typically more of a shy, quiet person. Nonetheless, they exhibit adaptability by becoming more outgoing when needed.
