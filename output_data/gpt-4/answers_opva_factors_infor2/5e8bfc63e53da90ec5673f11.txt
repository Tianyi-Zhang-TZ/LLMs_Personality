They express a strong desire to be precise, and they systematically arrange their workplace. They consider themselves as a quick learner and appear motivated to push themselves when faced with challenging tasks. Similarly, they mentioned that when they want something badly at work, they opt to be patient and wait for the right opportunity instead of impulsively acting on their desires. 

As for Extraversion, there are plenty of indications that the person has a quite outgoing personality. They describe themselves as being friendly, social, and talkative, especially in new environments. They also enjoy being around people and aim to support others when they feel down, are not afraid to take leading roles, and actively participate in group discussions.
