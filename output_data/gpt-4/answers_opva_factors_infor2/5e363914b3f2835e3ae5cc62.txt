Conscientiousness: 4.7
The respondent consistently displayed a high level of Conscientiousness through consistent attention to detail, adherence to rules, ability to double-check their work, and persistence in challenging tasks. They repeatedly showed that they take their responsibilities seriously and are able to manage their impulses, for instance, when they decided not to break rules to get an item they wanted. These traits all indicate a very high level of conscientiousness, which is why I have rated it a 4.7. 

Extraversion: 2.9
The respondent has shown some efforts in engaging in social settings such as making efforts to make conversation when uncomfortable, contributing to group discussions and trying to raise morale in the workplace. Her extraversion is evident in scenarios where she takes lead roles and tries to engage with others. However, her tendency to be uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings and decision to not attend the after-work event, despite a polite excuse, shows that she may not inherently seek out social interactions. Therefore, while she does possess some traits of an extravert, she also exhibits introverted characteristics, which is why I have given a rating of 2.9.
