Conscientiousness: 3.6 
Extraversion: 3.2 

In terms of Conscientiousness, the person seems to be detailed oriented and focused, as seen in their drawing hobby, and in the situation where they put everything properly in place after using the kitchen equipment for babysitting. However, they also decided not to push themselves harder in the situation of folding the laundry, indicating a slight tendency towards procrastination or delegating tasks. So I would rate them a slight above average 3.6.

For Extraversion, this person showed evidence of being outgoing and sociable, particularly when they actively participated in the after-work social event and when they were able to raise the spirit of their team members at the Girl Scouts camp. However, their level of extraversion seems to be sensitive to the particular context of the social setting, as shown by their discomfort at the college party where they didn't feel welcome. Hence, the person falls slightly above the midpoint of the scale, with a rating of 3.2.
