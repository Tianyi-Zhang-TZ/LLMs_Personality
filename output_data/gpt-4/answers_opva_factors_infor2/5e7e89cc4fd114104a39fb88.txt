Conscientiousness: 4.3 
The respondent demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness through their behaviors at work, which include diligent attention to detail, diligent organization, and the willingness to take on difficult tasks and work through problems themselves. They also show restraint against impulsive behaviors, such as resisting an impulse buy at work. Their rating could be slightly higher if they showed some higher levels of self-discipline and acted more independently in challenging situations.

Extraversion: 3.6 
The person shows signs of both introversion and extraversion. In social settings, they show a moderate level of comfort and take initiative to be polite, despite feeling initially agitated and not recognizing anybody. They even tend to take a leading role in group discussions, aiming to involve everyone, and try to uplift team members when they feel down. However, skipping the after-work social event might reflect a slightly lower score as this can be considered an introverted behavior. Although it's important to note that this decision was due to their imminent departure from the job rather than discomfort in social interaction.
