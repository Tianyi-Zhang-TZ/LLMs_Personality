Conscientiousness: 2.5 
Extraversion: 3.0 

The ratings reflect a moderate level of conscientiousness and a slightly higher level for extraversion based on the person's responses. In regards to conscientiousness, although the answers are somewhat vague, the respondent expresses both tendencies to seek out and use resources and other times not really taking initiative, which indicates an average level of conscientiousness. 

Concerning extraversion, the person's responses show that they have some levels of comfort in social settings and enjoy learning from others, which speaks to an above average level of sociability and tendency to communicate. However, their comfort in large social settings can sometimes vary and they mention not feeling like a great speaker, hence a rating of 3.0.
