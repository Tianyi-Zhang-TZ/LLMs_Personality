Conscientiousness: 4.8 
The respondent shows high levels of conscientiousness through their focus on organization, attention to detail, and commitment to duties regardless of whether or not they enjoy them particularly. From organizing their office before leaving work to maintaining focus and checking work frequently when dealing with meticulous tasks, they prove to be reliable, diligent, efficient, and careful. Their ability to control impulses and handle situations professionally, even while dealing with disappointment at work, further signifies high conscientiousness.

Extraversion: 4.5 
The respondent is also highly extroverted. They display clear confidence and comfortability in several social situations, even those where they hardly knew anyone. They are willing to take the lead in group discussions when nobody else steps up, indicating assertiveness. Also, the respondent's aptness to connect with others on a personal level, such as checking up on team members one-on-one after a disappointment, showcases a certain level of sociability. The only reason for not scoring them 5.0 is their expressed need for some personal time and separation from work events, indicating a slight preference for solitude and quiet time.
