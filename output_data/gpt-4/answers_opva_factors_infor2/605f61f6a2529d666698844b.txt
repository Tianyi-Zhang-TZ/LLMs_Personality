Conscientiousness: 4.2
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual appears to be highly conscientious which can be seen from their consistent attention to details, their dedication to completing tasks efficiently, their regular usage and proper maintenance of equipment at work, and their tendency to go beyond the usual channels when they want something badly at work. All these suggest a highly disciplined, dependable, and goal-oriented personality, which aligns well with the conscientiousness trait.

On the other hand, they seem to be somewhat introverted. The person does not appear comfortable in unfamiliar social settings. They also prefer to skip social events after work, choosing personal time over group interactions. Additionally, they seem to prefer a listening role rather than leading during group discussions. However, they show some interest in helping their colleagues when they're feeling down, which introduces some degree of social engagement and therefore prevents a lower score in the extraversion scale.
