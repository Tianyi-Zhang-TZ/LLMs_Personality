Conscientiousness: 4.0 
The person demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness. They show they are capable of paying attention to the details (e.g., Question 6) and thinking through their actions before making decisions (e.g., Question 8). However, in some cases, their commitment to perfection and the resultant effort, seems conditional and dependent on the perceived payout (e.g., Question 4). This prevents a full score.

Extraversion: 2.0 
While they do engage in social situations and even in leadership roles (e.g., Question 3), they often reveal a preference for solitary activities and a lack of inherent enjoyment in social interaction (e.g., Questions 1 and 5). They'll step up to motivate team members, but that too appears to be conditional on the perceived personal benefit (e.g., Question 7). Consequently, their level of extraversion is lower.
