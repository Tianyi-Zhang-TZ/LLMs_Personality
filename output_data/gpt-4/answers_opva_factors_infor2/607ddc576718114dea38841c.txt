Conscientiousness: 4.8
Extraversion: 3.6

The Conscientiousness rating is extremely high as the person consistently describes themselves as meticulous, dedicated, and reliable. The majority of their responses hinge on their detail-oriented nature, their drive to complete tasks to the best of their ability, and their commitment to organization and thoroughness. They repeatedly mention their tenacious and slightly obsessive qualities, which reflects a strong degree of conscientiousness.

Their Extraversion score is not extraordinarily high, but still above average, as they frequently mention their eagerness to engage with others, even in uncomfortable social situations. They display consistent effort to interact and connect with others, displaying both their empathy and intention of forming trustful relationships. However, their self-identification as an introvert who sometimes assumes the role of an “extrovert introvert” suggests a degree of reservation, lowering their score on the Extraversion scale somewhat. Despite that, they do exhibit a fair amount of outgoing and gregarious behavior, boosting their Extraversion score above the midpoint.
