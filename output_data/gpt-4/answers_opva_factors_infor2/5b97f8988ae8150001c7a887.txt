Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.5

The person seems to have average conscientiousness as indicated by his responses. They show a desire to do things efficiently and follow procedures but also recount instances where there were oversights or the individual was overwhelmed. This points to moderate conscientiousness in situations with work and tasks. 

Regarding extraversion, the person doesn't shy away from social situations completely but would rather not be the centre of attention or leading a conversation. They are comfortable in social spaces and even make efforts to engage with people they don't know. However, there is clear discomfort and they're more of a listener than a speaker. This seems to indicate a slightly lower than average level of extraversion, suggesting they lean more towards introversion but with the capability to handle and get involved social situations when needed.
