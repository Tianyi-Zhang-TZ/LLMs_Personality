Whether it was putting back equipment in place, taking on an extensive role in group projects, or paying attention to intricate details in tasks, they showed a high level of conscientiousness. They also showed a willingness to push past comfort zones to meet responsibilities. This is mostly evidenced in their role during the school club creation.

Moreover, during the after-work social event scenario, they showed enthusiasm for social connections and demonstrated empathy towards team members in low spirits, suggesting interpersonal skills.
