Conscientiousness: 3.8
Extraversion: 3.5

The individual demonstrates traits of being somewhat conscientious. From their responses, they seem to take their duties seriously, especially when it comes to organizing and completing tasks at work (Question 2 & 4). They also show responsibility for their actions and are not afraid of challenges. However, they admitted to moments where they didn't pay attention to detail, making a few mistakes and upsetting clients (Question 6). They seem to have a good level of impulse control, but admit there is potential for lapses (Question 8), hence not a perfect score.

In terms of Extraversion, they identify as being more extroverted than in the past but still retain some shy characteristics, especially in social settings and when meeting new people (Question 1 & 5). They proactively take leading roles in group discussions and make an effort to uplift team members' spirits (Question 3 and 7), showing an outgoing nature which is indicative of extraversion. So overall, they show a reasonable level of this trait but are still somewhat uncomfortable and nervous in certain social situations. Hence, they couldn't get a perfect score.
