Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual shows a high degree of conscientiousness in her responses, indicating that she values organization, thoroughness, and dedication. She frequently describes putting things back in order, paying careful attention to detail, pushing herself to finish difficult tasks, and thinking through her actions meticulously before acting on impulse. This demonstrates a high degree of conscientiousness, rated at 4.5. The rating is not a perfect score because she seems to rely on certain external factors to step up (e.g., her son's needs), and may not always push for perfect execution if physical capabilities are limited.

Extraversion: 2.5
The individual shows some characteristics of extraversion such as valuing social connection and wanting to make people around her happy and comfortable. However, she also identifies herself as shy, not usually comfortable with leading role in groups, does not enjoy social events, and considers herself a homebody. These characteristics demonstrate introverted traits, thus suggesting the individual lies somewhere in the middle of the extraversion scale, hence the rating is 2.5.
