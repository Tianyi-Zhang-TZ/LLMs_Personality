Extraversion: 4.0
This individual displays a good level of Extraversion. However, the rating isn't as high as Conscientiousness because the person seems to lean more towards being an observer in social settings, and tends to listen more than they talk in group discussions.

To sum up, the responses reflect an individual who is highly Conscientious â€“ organized, detail-oriented, and consistent.
