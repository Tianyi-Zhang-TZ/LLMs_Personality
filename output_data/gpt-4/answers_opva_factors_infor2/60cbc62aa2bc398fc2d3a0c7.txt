Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 4.2

Justification:

Conscientiousness: The individual appears to be quite reliable and disciplined in their responses. For example, despite admitting their struggles with organization due to ADHD (Question 2), they demonstrate a serious commitment to the tasks they are entrusted with, showcasing their willingness to develop systems to overcome obstacles and correct their mistakes (Question 2, 4, 6, 8). The fact that they love challenges and prefer not to simplify or pass the work to someone else indicates their high degree of persistence and dependability. These aspects suggest a high level of conscientiousness, though there are some indications of occasional struggles with organization and attention to detail, hence the score of 4.5.

Extraversion: The person seems quite outgoing and enjoys socializing (Questions 1, 3, 5, 7), often stepping out of their comfort zone to interact with others and taking active roles in group discussions. They also express a tendency to help and cheer up others and derive pleasure from doing so. These traits suggest a relatively high level of extraversion. However, the individual also admits to having been shy in the past and sometimes facing difficulty in spontaneously advocating for themselves (Question 8) which suggests they may not always be completely comfortable in social situations. Thus, the score of 4.2 for extraversion.
