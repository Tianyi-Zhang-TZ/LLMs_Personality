Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 3.0 

Reasoning:
The individual demonstrated a high level of Conscientiousness across their responses. They often mentioned taking extra measures to ensure work is done accurately and considerately, going the extra mile to ensure things are orderly and well-maintained for other people's use. They also showed a propensity for self-evaluation and careful decision making instead of acting on impulses. This indicates a high level of conscientiousness, hence a high rating of 4.5 is given.

Their score for Extraversion, however, is somewhat moderate. Although they showed a substantial degree of social orientation, warmth and enthusiasm in some contexts (e.g., in a sports team or in a camp counselor setting), they also described themselves as feeling uncomfortable in unfamiliar social settings, leaning towards a more reserved demeanor in group discussions and not feeling the need to interact with co-workers outside of work. These responses portray a mixture of extroverted and introverted tendencies, thus yielding a middle-of-the-road score of 3.0 for Extraversion.
