Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.7

Explanation: 

The individual demonstrated high conscientiousness as seen from various instances of him/her being detail-oriented, responsible, and hard working. Answers to question 2, 4, 6 and 8 all highlight a preference for being organized, concern for mistakes and due diligence, which are key characteristics of conscientiousness. He/she also showed the willingness to take on additional responsibilities or plan meticulously when required, reaffirming high conscientiousness. 

While the individual displayed average extraversion, there had been several occurrences where introverted tendencies were evident. For instance, in question 1 he/she mentioned feeling uncomfortable and shy when placed in a new social environment and having difficulties initiating conversations. While he/she seemed to have grown more open and outgoing with time, situations like the challenge of a cultural barrier indicated some effort required to become comfortable in social settings. However, his/her active participation in social events (Question 5) and effort to raise team spirits during challenging times (Question 7) suggest a fair level of outgoingness and sociability which are essential characteristics of extraversion. This consequently gives an overall above-average level of extraversion.
