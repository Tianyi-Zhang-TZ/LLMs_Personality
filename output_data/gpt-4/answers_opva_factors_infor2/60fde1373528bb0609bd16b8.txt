Conscientiousness: 4.5 
The individual described themselves as organized, tidy, determined and always striving to do their best. They take time to think decisions through and they push their limits to keep improving. These are key attributes in determining high conscientiousness as they are common traits of individuals who are thorough, careful, reliable and have a strong will to achieve their goals.

Extraversion: 2.5 
The individual tends to be more introverted in their behavior. They are often selective about social events and prefer to remain in roles where they are more comfortable such as a listener instead of a leader and join social events with known associates, which indicate lower levels of extraversion. However, their willingness to help teammates and make others feel comfortable shows a streak of extraversion that slightly balances their overall score. Overall, they fall in the midrange of the extroversion scale, neither highly extroverted nor extremely introverted.
