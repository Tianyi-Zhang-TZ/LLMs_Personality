Conscientiousness: 4.5 
Extraversion: 2.0 

Justification: 

From the responses, the person to an extent showed a good amount of Conscientiousness as they displayed responsibility, reliability, and carefulness. They described trying to handle challenging situations at work and being focused on paying attention to detail especially when it comes to making sure things are correct at work. Also, in regards to a challenging work situation, they said, “I just try to get it done”, which indicates a completion of tasks, an aspect of Conscientiousness.

The Extraversion trait, however, is low. The person described feeling uncomfortable in social settings, especially where sports were being discussed and they felt left out. They also mentioned that they're not a big social person and would usually keep to themselves and tend to opt out of social gatherings.
These answers suggest they tend more towards introversion, thus the low score on Extraversion.
