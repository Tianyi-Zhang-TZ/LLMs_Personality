Conscientiousness: 4.2
The individual comes off as quite conscientious through their answers. They show a clear attention to detail, a preference for orderliness, and show a clear willingness to put in effort to accomplish tasks. They also express their agency in situations of difficulty. For instance, they talk about how they were determined when a task was challenging at school, pushing themselves more to overcome difficulties. Their tendency to help others and not leave tasks incomplete can also be a sign of them being reliable, implying conscientiousness. However, they themselves admitted to being impulsive, which is a trait not typically associated with high conscientiousness, hence the score is not nearer to 5.

Extraversion: 2.5
The individual shows a mix of extraversion and introversion throughout the answers. Though they acknowledged that they have been anxious in social situations and prefer to keep their work and personal life separate, which are traits typifying a lower level of extraversion, they also displayed instances of behavioral extraversion. For example, they illustrated how they took on a leading role during a group discussion and were ready to raise the spirit of their team members when it was low. These situations require sociability, assertion, and other qualities associated with extraversion. Hence, a midpoint score seems most appropriate in this case as the responses hint at a balance between extraverted and introverted tendencies.
