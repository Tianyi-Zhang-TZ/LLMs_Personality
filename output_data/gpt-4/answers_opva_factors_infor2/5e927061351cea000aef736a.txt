Conscientiousness: 4.6 
The individual showed significant evidence of being responsible, organized and having a diligent nature. They consistently described themselves in roles where they kept their workspace clean, meticulously planned for and executed tasks such as studying for the DAT and precise dental procedures. They also showed initiative and a proactive mindset when they immediately signed up to Proctor the SAT when the opportunity arose. 

Extraversion: 4.2 
The person also demonstrated characteristics of an extravert. They were open about being comfortable in social situations where they knew few, if any, people, such as attending a nightclub alone or a lab mate's party. They also showed a willingness and ability to positively influence and motivate their team members. However, their tendency to take a backseat in group discussions indicates some introverted traits, thus reducing their score slightly. Their overall comfort and engagement in social settings and ability to influence others still suggest a high level of extraversion.
