Persuasiveness: 4.0 - The candidate was able to persuade their colleagues to execute a beneficial training plan and has shown strong reasoning and negotiating skills. However, we didn't see evidence of their capability to persuade in a broader context or under high-stakes conditions.

Their dedication to task completion, ability to work in a group, leadership skills and communication flexibility align with the expectations of the position. However, they may benefit from further development in interpersonal skills in social settings and the development of a more strategic approach to personal and professional development.
