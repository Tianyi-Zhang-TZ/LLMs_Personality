Communication flexibility: 4.0 - The interviewee demonstrated good adaptability to different social situations and was able to alter their communication style to match those situations, even if not always efficiently or comfortably.

Persuasiveness: 3.0 - The interviewee was able to advocate for the purchase of a new server at work, explaining the reasons why it was beneficial. However, other examples showed less initiative and, sometimes, lack of persuasion skills, such as not taking the lead in a group discussion despite having ideas.

Quality orientation: 3.5 - The interviewee was generally focused on quality, as evidenced by his efforts to carefully follow procedures during upgrades and ensure tasks were completed correctly. However, there were instances where equipment was not put back in place immediately after use, which may have impacted productivity.

Development orientation: 3.0 - While the interviewee expressed discomfort in unfamiliar situations, he did show a willingness to put himself out there and learn. However, they did not necessarily seek out learning opportunities or push themselves in challenging situations.

Overall hireability: 3.5 - The interviewee showed good communication skills and a focus on quality. However, for a leadership traineeship, it would be beneficial to demonstrate a stronger development orientation and more initiative. They did exhibit some leadership characteristics - such as stepping in to cheer up a downcast coworker - that could be built upon with the right training and support.
