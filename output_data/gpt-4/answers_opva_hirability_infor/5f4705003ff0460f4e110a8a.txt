Communication flexibility: 3.0
The candidate demonstrated their ability to express themselves in different ways depending, on the circumstances and their level of comfortability, but not extensively.

Persuasiveness: 2.0
The interviewee showed little ability to convince or persuade others. They stated that they prefer to comply with authority rather than taking the initiative.

Quality orientation: 4.5
The candidate illustrated a high focus on quality, specifically with tasks that required attention to details. They mentioned several times their habit of double-checking their work.

Development orientation: 3.5
The candidate showed a willingness to learn and grow. However, they seem to prefer using their own skills over seeking help proactively. They also mentioned the importance of pushing themselves to tackle challenging tasks.

Overall hireability: 3.0
The interviewee seems introverted, which is not a bad quality. They would, however, need to develop their assertiveness, courage to take the lead in certain situations, and ability to persuade others. Their predisposition to quality orientation and detail attention is a plus, but they might need to work on their communication skills on a daily basis in a team environment.
