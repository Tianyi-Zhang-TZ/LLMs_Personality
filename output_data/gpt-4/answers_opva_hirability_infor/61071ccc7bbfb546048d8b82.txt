Communication flexibility: 3.5 
The candidate showed a nuanced understanding of social and work dynamics and is evidently comfortable conveying messages in different ways as needed. However, the candidate could improve on their ability to articulate thoughts in a concise and easily digestible manner.

Persuasiveness: 3.0 
The interviewee demonstrated a level of persuasiveness in that the responses included a fair amount of self-reflection and acknowledgment of the tasks undertaken to improve personal strengths and weaknesses. However, the responses could have been more persuasive with a more assured stance and fewer digressions.

Quality orientation: 4.0 
The candidate revealed a clear understanding of the importance of quality work. The responses implied a meticulous approach and the ability to maintain detailed focus, especially on technical tasks in the lab.

Development orientation: 4.0 
The interviewee demonstrated a proactiveness to develop themselves professionally, evident in the efforts to push out of their comfort zone, take on challenging tasks and work on weaknesses. This suggests that the candidate has a strong development orientation.

Overall hireability: 3.5 
The candidate showed good potential to be a productive member of any team, especially due to the demonstrated self-motivation to improve and learn. However, the degree of extraversion and persuasiveness, which seems to be important for this management traineeship at Aur√©lien, seems to be areas where the candidate could improve.
