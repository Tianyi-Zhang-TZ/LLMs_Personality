Reasoning: The responses from this interviewee are all over the place and lack coherence, making it extremely difficult to decipher their communication flexibility or persuasiveness. Their answers are not only unstructured but also do not provide enough information to make an assessment on their ability to provide high-quality work or grow professionally.
