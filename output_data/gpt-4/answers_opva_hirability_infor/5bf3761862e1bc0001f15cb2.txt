Communication flexibility: 3.0. The candidate demonstrates considerable listening skills, but could potentially struggle with adapting their communication style to suit different settings or audiences, due to their introverted nature. 

Persuasiveness: 2.0. The candidate is more reserved, preferring to listen rather than take a leading role in discussions. This could potentially limit their ability to persuasively articulate their point of view and gain acceptance from others. 

Quality orientation: 4.5. The candidate’s meticulous and perfectionistic nature makes them very oriented to delivering high-quality work. They pay great attention to details and are willing to put in the effort to avoid making mistakes.

Development orientation: 4.0. They show a willingness to push themselves harder when tasks are challenging and typically do not pass on tasks to others. This suggests that they are willing to develop and enhance their skills and professionalism, even in face of difficulties.

Overall hireability: 3.0. While the candidate's introverted nature, meticulous attention to detail and commitment to self-development are commendable, their limited persuasiveness and flexible communication skills might pose a challenge in a work environment that requires teamwork, leadership and interaction with people. The candidate might need to work on their communication and leadership skills to maximise their potential in a traineeship at Aurélien.
