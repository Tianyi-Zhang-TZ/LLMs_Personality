Communication flexibility: 4.0 
The candidate portrayed good communication flexibility, they were comfortable altering their communication style to suit different situations, and were able to articulate their points effectively. However, there were some signs of repetition and difficulty in articulating complex thoughts which slightly lowers the rating.

Persuasiveness: 3.8 
The interviewee displayed modest abilities in terms of persuasiveness. They understand the need to explain their point of view to others and try to influence their opinions. However, there was not significant evidence of them using strong, compelling arguments to sway others. 

Quality orientation: 4.5 
The candidate demonstrated a high concern for quality in their work. They value organization and likes to ensure that they can deliver high-quality work. This is evident in their explanation of how they managed their tasks particularly in a research lab, during a challenging task at work and during group discussions.

Development orientation: 4.7 
It's clear that the candidate is keen on developing themselves as seen during their time at University and their willingness to step out of their comfort zone in social settings. They are focused on self-improvement and gaining new experiences.

Overall hireability: 4.3 
Given their demonstrated quality and development orientation, the candidate impresses as someone who would be a great asset to the team. The lower rating in persuasiveness and communication flexibility, suggest they might need some more training in argumentation and expressing complex ideas. However, the candidate can be well suited for the traineeship position at Aurelien, and with further development can have really high potential.
