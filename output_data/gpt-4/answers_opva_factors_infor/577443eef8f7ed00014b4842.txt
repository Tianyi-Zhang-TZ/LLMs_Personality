Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 4.5 

The individual appears to be quite comfortable in social situations and enjoys meeting new people (Question 1 and 3), which suggests a higher level of Extraversion. Additionally, the individual is willing to go out of their way to raise team members' spirits (Question 7), which further supports a higher Extraversion rating.

In terms of Conscientiousness, the individual consistently displays attention to detail and follows set procedures to avoid mistakes (Questions 2 and 6). They also prioritize completing tasks and putting in extra effort to ensure they are done correctly (Question 4). This indicates a high level of Conscientiousness.
