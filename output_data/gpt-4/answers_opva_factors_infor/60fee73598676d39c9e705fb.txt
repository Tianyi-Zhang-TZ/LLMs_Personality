Conscientiousness: 4.0 
Extraversion: 2.5 

The individual demonstrated a high level of conscientiousness by being diligent, morally motivated, and paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes. They also valued their behavior and how they come off to others around them. 

On the other hand, the individual demonstrated a lower level of extraversion by being socially anxious, introverted, and generally not the most outgoing person. They tend to take on a primarily listening role in group discussions and only assume a leading role when there is no one else to fill that role. However, they do push themselves to attend social events and try to push their boundaries a little bit. Overall, the individual's personality seems to be more in line with conscientiousness than extraversion.
