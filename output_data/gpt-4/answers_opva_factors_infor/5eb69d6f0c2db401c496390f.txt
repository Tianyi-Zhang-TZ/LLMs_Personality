Extraversion: 3.0
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual showed some tendencies towards extraversion, but not consistently across all questions. They were comfortable in social situations and able to take a leading role in group discussions, but also felt exhausted and skipped an after-work event. On the other hand, they consistently displayed conscientiousness by paying attention to details, creating a roadmap to tackle challenges, and ensuring that everything was in place at work. Their personality was also sympathetic towards team members who were feeling down. Overall, their conscientiousness seemed to be more prominent than their extraversion.
