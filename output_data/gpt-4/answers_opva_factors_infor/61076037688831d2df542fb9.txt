Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness in their attention to detail and organization in the workplace, as well as their persistence and self-motivation in completing challenging tasks. However, their overall tendency towards introversion is reflected in their discomfort in social settings and preference for working independently. While they make efforts to socialize and raise team spirits, they may not always act on impulsive desires in order to achieve their goals.
