Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual appears to be highly conscientious based on their responses to questions 2, 4, and 6, where they demonstrate a strong attention to detail, organization, and a willingness to push themselves to complete tasks. However, their responses to questions 1, 3, and 5 suggest that they are less extraverted, as they report feeling uncomfortable in social situations with new people, preferring to take a listening role in group discussions, and not acting on impulse to attend after-work events.
