Extraversion: 2.5 
Conscientiousness: 3.5 

The individual's responses indicate a moderate level of extraversion as they have shared experiences where they have felt uncomfortable in social situations and prefer not to attend after-work social events, but have also shown willingness to participate in group discussions and take on a leading role. They have also described instances where they acted on impulse to get something they wanted, indicating a lower level of conscientiousness, but they have also demonstrated a higher level of conscientiousness by paying attention to details in order to avoid making mistakes and pushing themselves harder when faced with a challenging task. Overall, their responses suggest a balanced personality with slightly higher conscientiousness than extraversion.
