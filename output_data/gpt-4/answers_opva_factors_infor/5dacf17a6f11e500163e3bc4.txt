Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual describes themselves as shy and reserved, which suggests they may not score high on the Extraversion factor. However, they also show a willingness to engage with others in social settings, take on leadership roles in group discussions, and attend after-work social events despite their introverted tendencies. This indicates that they do have some level of Extraversion, although it may not be their dominant personality trait.

On the other hand, the individual shows a high level of Conscientiousness in their approach to tasks. They push themselves to overcome challenges, are detail-oriented, and take their time to carefully consider decisions rather than acting impulsively. These behaviors suggest a strong tendency towards Conscientiousness.

Overall, the individual appears to score slightly higher on Conscientiousness than Extraversion.
