Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.7

The person seems to be highly conscientious based on their descriptions of valuing a clean and tidy work environment, pushing themselves harder when faced with a challenging task, and being detail-oriented in their work. They also appear to be rational thinkers who do not act on impulse. However, their descriptions of feeling uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone, taking a leading role in group discussions, and valuing social connections outside of work suggest moderate levels of extraversion.
