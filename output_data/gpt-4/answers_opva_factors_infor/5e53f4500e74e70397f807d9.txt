Extraversion: 3.5
Conscientiousness: 4.0

The individual seems to be moderately extraverted, as they are able to observe and interact with others in social situations, but can also feel shy and avoidant of new social situations. They seem to be more conscientious, as they are task-oriented and detail-oriented in their work, and are motivated to push themselves to achieve their goals. Overall, the individual seems to have a good balance between both factors.
