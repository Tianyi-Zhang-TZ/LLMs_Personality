Extraversion: 2.5
Conscientiousness: 3.5

The person tends to be relatively shy and uncomfortable in social situations (Question 1), but also willing to attend work-related social events if it will have a positive effect on them or the company (Question 5). They also tend to take a listening role in group discussions (Question 3) and prefer to help team members with specific problems rather than trying to raise their spirits with an impulsive speech (Question 7). 

On the other hand, the person is detail-oriented and conscientious in completing tasks, even when they are challenging (Question 2 and Question 6). They also have a competitive nature and prefer to push themselves to finish tasks rather than relying on others (Question 4). Overall, the person's responses suggest a slightly higher level of conscientiousness than extraversion.
