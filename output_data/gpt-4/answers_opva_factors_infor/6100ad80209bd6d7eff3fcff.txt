Conscientiousness: 3.5 
Extraversion: 4.0 

The person seems to be moderately conscientious as they prioritize completing tasks and putting things back in their place, but may not be naturally detail-oriented. They also seem to be willing to push themselves to complete challenging tasks, but may seek guidance from others before deciding to take on a task. 

They appear to be more extraverted as they are comfortable being outgoing and chatty in social situations, enjoy attending after-work events, and are willing to take on a leadership or listening role in group discussions. They also seem to care about the emotions of their team members and are willing to lift them up when they are feeling down.
