The individual seems to be moderately conscientious, as they prioritize attention to detail and avoiding mistakes in their work tasks, but may struggle with asking for help when necessary. They also tend to avoid impulsive actions and take time to make decisions.

In terms of extraversion, the individual appears to be quite introverted, as they feel uncomfortable in social settings with unfamiliar people and often prefer to spend time alone rather than attending social events.
