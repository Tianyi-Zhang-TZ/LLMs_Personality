Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The person shows a high level of conscientiousness in situations where attention to detail and follow-through are required, such as completing tasks at work and putting equipment back in place. They also demonstrate a desire to push themselves harder when faced with challenges. However, their score on extraversion is lower, as they tend to feel uncomfortable in social situations where they don't know anyone and may not be inclined to attend after-work events. They do show some willingness to raise team members' spirits when they are feeling down, but this seems to be less natural for them than the other traits associated with conscientiousness.
