Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.0

The individual shows a tendency towards being conscientious, as seen in their responses to Q2 and Q4 where they demonstrate a sense of responsibility and commitment towards completing tasks. However, their responses to Q1, Q3, Q5, and Q7 suggest a preference for introversion over extraversion, as they tend to be reserved and uncomfortable in social situations and group discussions, and do not enjoy being the center of attention or engaging in small talk outside of work.
