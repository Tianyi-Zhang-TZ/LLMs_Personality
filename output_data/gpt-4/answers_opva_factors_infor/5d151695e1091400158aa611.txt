Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a high level of conscientiousness in their approach to work tasks and attention to detail, as seen in their responses to questions 2, 4, 6, and 8. They prioritize responsibility and respect for others' time and shared spaces, which are indicators of conscientiousness. 

However, they demonstrate a lower level of extraversion throughout their responses, with a tendency towards reserve and listening rather than leading or taking assertive action. This is particularly evident in their responses to questions 1, 3, 5, and 7. While they are not opposed to social events, they tend to prefer decompression time alone or with close friends rather than engaging in large group settings.
