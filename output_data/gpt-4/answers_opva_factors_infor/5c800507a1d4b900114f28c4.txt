Extraversion: 3.5 
Conscientiousness: 4.0 

The person appears to be moderately extraverted, as they tend to stick closely to familiar people in social settings but can also participate in group discussions and try to raise team members' spirits. They also seem to be highly conscientious, paying close attention to details and pushing themselves to complete tasks even when it may not be necessary. However, there is a slight impulsiveness shown in the desire to move up at work, which ultimately led to negative consequences.
