Extraversion: 4.0 
Conscientiousness: 3.0 

The person seems to be outgoing, talkative, and enjoys being in social situations (Question 1, 3, 5, 7). They also appear to be eager to raise others' spirits and help out their team members (Question 7). However, they may struggle with paying attention to detail and may become stressed in situations where attention to detail is required (Question 2, 6). They also tend to act impulsively at times, especially in morally neutral situations (Question 8). Overall, the person's personality leans towards extraversion more than conscientiousness but still shows some level of conscientiousness.
