Conscientiousness: 3.5
Extraversion: 2.0

The individual's responses suggest that they have a moderate level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their willingness to take charge and be assertive in certain situations, but also their tendency to avoid tasks that are challenging or outside of their job responsibilities. However, their responses also indicate a low level of extraversion, as they tend to feel uncomfortable in social situations, prefer to work alone, and do not go out of their way to uplift the spirits of their coworkers.
