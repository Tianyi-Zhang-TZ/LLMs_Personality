Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 3.0

The individual seems to prioritize being responsible and diligent in their work tasks (as seen in Question 2 and 4), but also exhibits a tendency towards introversion and discomfort in social situations (as seen in Questions 1, 3, and 5). They do show some willingness to engage in social activities for the sake of team bonding (Question 5) and have a drive to advance their career (Question 8), but overall their personality seems to lean more towards conscientiousness than extraversion.
