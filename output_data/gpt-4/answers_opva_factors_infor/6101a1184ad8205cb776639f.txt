Conscientiousness: 4.5
Extraversion: 3.5

The individual demonstrated a high level of conscientiousness, as evidenced by their tendency to follow instructions closely, their attention to detail, and their determination to solve problems independently. They also displayed some qualities related to extraversion, such as being sociable and comfortable in social situations, as well as being caring and supportive towards others. However, their tendency to take a listening role in group discussions and their decision to skip a social event due to external factors suggest that they may not be as strongly extraverted as they are conscientious.
