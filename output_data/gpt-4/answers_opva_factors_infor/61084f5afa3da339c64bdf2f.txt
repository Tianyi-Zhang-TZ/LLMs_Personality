Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual shows a relatively high level of conscientiousness, as they consistently demonstrate attention to detail, a desire to complete tasks correctly, and a willingness to take responsibility for their work. They also express concern for the impact of their actions on others, such as cleaning up after themselves and being aware of their role in a team.

However, their extraversion rating is lower, as they often describe feeling anxious or uncomfortable in social situations, especially when they don't know the people involved. They also tend to be more reserved and internalize their thoughts and feelings rather than actively engaging with others to raise their spirits or take on a leadership role.
