Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The person seems to be quite conscientious, as they mentioned being focused on work, paying attention to details, and not acting on impulse in various situations. They also seem to be responsible and organized when it comes to tasks and equipment at work. However, their extraversion score is lower, as they described themselves as awkward in social situations, preferring to listen rather than lead in group discussions, and being cautious about approaching others when they seem down. They do enjoy after-work social events, but they tend to keep to themselves, which indicates a more introverted personality.
