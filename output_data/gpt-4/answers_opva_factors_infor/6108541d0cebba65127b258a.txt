Conscientiousness: 4.0
Extraversion: 2.5

The individual demonstrates a strong sense of conscientiousness through their attention to detail, determination to complete tasks, and communication with supervisors. They also show a willingness to push themselves in certain situations and take responsibility for their actions. However, their extraversion rating is lower due to their preference for being a listener rather than a leader, being more of a homebody, and shyness in social situations. They do show some extraverted qualities, such as supporting and caring for others, but overall, they lean more towards introversion.
