Conscientiousness: 4.0

The person seems to be moderately extraverted based on their comfort level in social situations and ability to take on leadership roles in group discussions. However, they also express discomfort in unfamiliar social settings and may struggle to be outgoing when they don't know anyone. 

On the other hand, the person appears to be highly conscientious based on their willingness to push themselves harder and pay attention to details in challenging situations, as well as their consideration of the facts before acting impulsively. They also show a strong sense of responsibility towards their work and team members, as evidenced by their efforts to boost morale and commitment to completing tasks even when things get difficult.
